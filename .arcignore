# .arcignore is the same as .gitignore but for Arc VCS.
# Arc VCS is a proprietary VCS in Yandex that is very similar to Git
# from the user perspective but with the following differences:
# 1. Data is stored in distributed object storage.
# 2. Local copy works via FUSE without downloading all the objects.
# For this reason, it is better suited for huge monorepositories that can be found in large companies (e.g. Yandex, Google).
# As ClickHouse developers, we don't use Arc as a VCS (we use Git).
# But the ClickHouse source code is also mirrored into internal monorepository and our collegues are using Arc.
# You can read more about Arc here: https://habr.com/en/company/yandex/blog/482926/

# Repository is synchronized without 3rd-party submodules.
