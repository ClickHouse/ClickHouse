# can't do chown and owners of mounted volumes should be configured externally.
# We do that in advance at the begining of Dockerfile before any packages will be
# installed to prevent picking those uid / gid by some unrelated software.
# The same uid / gid (101) is used both for alpine and ubuntu.
