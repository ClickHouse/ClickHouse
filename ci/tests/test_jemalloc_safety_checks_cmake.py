"""Build-configuration guard for the jemalloc safety-check lane.

`ENABLE_JEMALLOC_SAFETY_CHECKS` must define **two** jemalloc macros, and both are
load-bearing for the `WeeklyJemallocSafety` lane:

* `JEMALLOC_OPT_SAFETY_CHECKS` arms `config_opt_safety_checks`
  (`contrib/jemalloc/include/jemalloc/internal/jemalloc_preamble.h.in:197`), which
  gates `arena_ptr_array_flush_impl`'s sized-deallocation detector.
* `JEMALLOC_OPT_SIZE_CHECKS` arms `config_opt_size_checks` (same file, `:216`),
  which is the **sole** gate on `maybe_check_alloc_ctx`
  (`jemalloc_internal_inlines_c.h:420-421`) - the check whose failure text is
  literally `"Internal heap corruption detected: mismatch in slab bit"`, i.e.
  exactly the union-view confusion this lane exists to catch.

The AST fuzzer job's runtime preflight
(`assert_jemalloc_safety_checks_armed` in `ci/jobs/ast_fuzzer_job.py`) can only
verify the first one: `config_opt_size_checks` has no mallctl, so it appears in
neither `contrib/jemalloc/src/ctl.c` nor `src/stats.c` and cannot be read out of the
built binary at all. Exposing one would mean patching `contrib/jemalloc`, which is a
submodule.

So the size gate is asserted here instead, at the layer where the two macros are
actually set. Losing either one leaves the lane green while removing detection, and
no platform header can cancel the size macro on its own (only the e2k header
bare-`#undef`s a macro, and only the safety one) - the single place an independent
loss can happen is the `target_compile_definitions` line this file checks.
