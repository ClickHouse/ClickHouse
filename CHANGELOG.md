# 2024 Changelog

### <a id="2412"></a> ClickHouse release 24.12, 2024-12-19

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Functions `greatest` and `least` now ignore NULL input values, whereas they previously returned NULL if one of the arguments was NULL. For example, `SELECT greatest(1, 2, NULL)` now returns 2. This makes the behavior compatible with PostgreSQL, but at the same time it breaks the compatibility with MySQL which returns NULL. To retain the previous behavior, set setting `least_greatest_legacy_null_behavior` (default: `false`) to `true`. [#65519](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65519) [#73344](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73344) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* A new MongoDB integration is now the default. Users who like to use the legacy MongoDB driver (based on the Poco driver) can enable server setting `use_legacy_mongodb_integration`. [#73359](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73359) ([Kirill Nikiforov](https://github.com/allmazz).

#### New Feature
* Move `JSON`/`Dynamic`/`Variant` types from experimental features to beta. [#72294](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72294) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)). We also backported all fixes as well as this change to 24.11.
* Schema evolution for the [Iceberg data storage](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#file-system-operations) format provides the user with extensive options for modifying the schema of their table. The order of columns, column names, and simple type extensions can be changed under the hood. [#69445](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69445) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Integrate with Iceberg REST Catalog: a new database engine, named Iceberg, which plugs the whole catalog into ClickHouse. [#71542](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71542) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Added cache for primary index of `MergeTree` tables (can be enabled by table setting `use_primary_key_cache`). If lazy load and cache are enabled for primary index, it will be loaded to cache on demand (similar to mark cache) instead of keeping it in memory forever. Added prewarm of primary index on inserts/mergs/fetches of data parts and on restarts of table (can be enabled by setting `prewarm_primary_key_cache`). This allows lower memory usage for huge tables on shared storage, and we tested it on tables over one quadrillion records. [#72102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72102) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)). [#72750](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72750) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Implement `SYSTEM LOAD PRIMARY KEY` command to load primary indexes for all parts of a specified table or for all tables if no table is specified. This will be useful for benchmarks and to prevent extra latency during query execution. [#66252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66252) [#67733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67733) ([ZAWA_ll](https://github.com/Zawa-ll)).
* Added a query that allows to attach `MergeTree` tables as `ReplicatedMergeTree` and vice versa: `ATTACH TABLE ... AS REPLICATED` and `ATTACH TABLE ... AS NOT REPLICATED`. [#65401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65401) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* A new setting, `http_response_headers` which allows you to customize the HTTP response headers. For example, you can tell the browser to render a picture that is stored in the database. This closes [#59620](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59620). [#72656](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72656) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add function `toUnixTimestamp64Second` which converts a `DateTime64` to a `Int64` value with fixed second precision, so we can support return negative value if date is before the unix epoch. [#70597](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70597) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)). [#73146](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73146) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Add new setting `enforce_index_structure_match_on_partition_manipulation` to allow attach when the set of source table's projections and secondary indices is a subset of those in the target table. Close [#70602](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70602). [#70603](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70603) ([zwy991114](https://github.com/zwy991114)).
* Add syntax ALTER USER {ADD|MODIFY|DROP SETTING}, ALTER USER {ADD|DROP PROFILE}, the same for ALTER ROLE and ALTER PROFILE. So instead of replacing all the set of settings, you can modify it. [#72050](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72050) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Added `arrayPRAUC` function, which calculates the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the Precision Recall curve. [#72073](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72073) ([Emmanuel](https://github.com/emmanuelsdias)).
* Add `indexOfAssumeSorted` function for array types. Optimizes the search in the case of a sorted in non-decreasing order array. The effect appears on very large arrays (over 100,000 elements). [#72517](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72517) ([Eric Kurbanov](https://github.com/erickurbanov)).
* Allows to use a delimiter as an optional second argument for aggregate function `groupConcat`. [#72540](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72540) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Function `translate` now supports character deletion if the `from` argument contains more characters than the `to` argument. Example: `SELECT translate('clickhouse', 'clickhouse', 'CLICK')` now returns `CLICK`. [#71441](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71441) ([shuai.xu](https://github.com/shuai-xu)).

#### Experimental Features
* A new MergeTree setting `allow_experimental_reverse_key` that enables support for descending sort order in MergeTree sorting keys. This is useful for time series analysis, especially TopN queries. Example usage: `ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY (time DESC, key)`- descending order for the `time` field. [#71095](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71095) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

#### Performance Improvement
* JOIN reordering. Added an option to select the side of the join that will act as the inner (build) table in the query plan. This is controlled by `query_plan_join_swap_table`, which can be set to `auto`. In this mode, ClickHouse will try to choose the table with the smallest number of rows. [#71577](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71577) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Now `parallel_hash` algorithm will be used (if applicable) when the `join_algorithm` setting is set to `default`. Two previous alternatives (`direct` and `hash`) are still considered when `parallel_hash` cannot be used. [#70788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70788) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Add option to extract common expressions from `WHERE` and `ON` expressions in order to reduce the number of hash tables used during joins. This makes sense when the JOIN ON condition has common parts inside AND in different OR parts. Can be enabled by `optimize_extract_common_expressions = 1`. [#71537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71537) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Allows to use indexes on `SELECT` when an indexed column is CAST into a `LowCardinality(String)`, which could be the case when a query run over a Merge table with some tables having `String` and some `LowCardinality(String)`. [#71598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71598) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* During query execution with parallel replicas and enabled local plan, do not perform index analysis on workers. The coordinator will choose ranges to read for workers based on index analysis on its side (on the query initiator). This makes short queries with parallel replicas have as low latency as single-node queries. [#72109](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72109) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Memory usage of `clickhouse disks remove --recursive` is reduced for object storage disks. [#67323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67323) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* Bring back optimization for reading subcolumns of single column in compact parts from [#57631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57631). It was deleted accidentally. [#72285](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72285) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Speedup sorting of `LowCardinality(String)` columns by de-virtualizing calls in comparator. [#72337](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72337) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Optimize function `argMin`/`argMax` for some simple data types. [#72350](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72350) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Optimize locking with shared locks in the memory tracker to reduce lock contention, which improves performance on systems with a very high number of CPU. [#72375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72375) ([Jiebin Sun](https://github.com/jiebinn)).
* Add a new setting, `use_async_executor_for_materialized_views`. Use async and potentially multithreaded execution of materialized view query, can speedup views processing during INSERT, but also consumes more memory. [#72497](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72497) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Improved performance of deserialization of states of aggregate functions (in data type `AggregateFunction` and in distributed queries). Slightly improved performance of parsing of format `RowBinary`. [#72818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72818) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Split ranges in reading with parallel replicas in the order of the table's key to consume less memory during reading. [#72173](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72173) ([JIaQi](https://github.com/JiaQiTang98)).
* Speed up insertions into merge tree in the case of a single value of partition key inside the inserted batch. [#72348](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72348) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Implement creating tables in parallel while restoring from a backup. Before this PR the `RESTORE` command always created tables in one thread, which could be slow in case of backups containing many tables. [#72427](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72427) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Dropping mark cache might take noticeable time if it is big. If we hold context mutex during this it block many other activities, even new client connection cannot be established until it is released. And holding this mutex is not actually required for synchronization, it is enough to have a local reference to the cache via shared ptr. [#72749](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72749) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).

#### Improvement
* Remove the `allow_experimental_join_condition` setting, allowing non-equi conditions by default. [#69910](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69910) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Settings from server config (users.xml) now apply on the client too. Useful for format settings, e.g. `date_time_output_format`. [#71178](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71178) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Automatic `GROUP BY`/`ORDER BY` to disk based on the server/user memory usage. Controlled with `max_bytes_ratio_before_external_group_by`/`max_bytes_ratio_before_external_sort` query settings. [#71406](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71406) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Adding a new cancellation logic: `CancellationChecker` checks timeouts for every started query and stops them once the timeout has reached. [#69880](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69880) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Support ALTER from `Object` to `JSON`, which means you can easily migrate from the deprecated Object type. [#71784](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71784) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow unknown values in set that are not present in Enum. Fix [#72662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72662). [#72686](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72686) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Support string search operator (e.g., LIKE) for `Enum` data type, implements [#72661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72661). [#72732](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72732) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Some meaningless ALTER USER queries were accepted. Fixes [#71227](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71227). [#71286](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71286) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Respect `prefer_locahost_replica` when building plan for distributed `INSERT ... SELECT`. [#72190](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72190) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Azure violated the Iceberg specification, mistakenly labeling Iceberg v1 as Iceberg v2. The problem is [described here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72091). Azure Iceberg Writer creates Iceberg metadata files (as well as manifest files) that violate specs. Now we attempt to read v1 Iceberg format metadata with the v2 reader (cause they write it in a this way), and added error when they didn't create corresponding fields in a manifest file. [#72277](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72277) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Now it's allowed to `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` with `UNION [ALL]` in query. Behavior is the same as for matview with `JOIN`: only the first table in `SELECT` expression will work as a trigger for insert, all other tables will be ignored. However, if there are many references to the first table (e.g., UNION with itself), all of them will be processed as the inserted block of data. [#72347](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72347) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Added source query validation when ClickHouse is used as a source for a dictionary. [#72548](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72548) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Ensure that ClickHouse will see ZooKeeper changes on config reloads. [#72593](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72593) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Better memory usage approximation of cached marks to reduce total memory usage of the cache. [#72630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72630) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add a new `StartupScriptsExecutionState` metric. The metric can have three values: 0 = startup scripts have not finished yet, 1 = startup scripts executed successfully, 2 = startup scripts failed. We need this metric because we need to know if startup scripts are being executed successfully in the cloud, especially after releases to base configurations. [#72637](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72637) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Add the new `MergeTreeIndexGranularityInternalArraysTotalSize` metric to `system.metrics`. This metric is needed to find the instances with huge datasets susceptible to the high 
* Add retries to creating a replicated table. [#72682](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72682) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add `total_bytes_with_inactive` to `system.tables` to count the total bytes of inactive parts. [#72690](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72690) ([Kai Zhu](https://github.com/nauu)).
* Add MergeTree settings to `system.settings_changes`. [#72694](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72694) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Support JSON type in the `notEmpty` function. [#72741](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72741) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support parsing GCS S3 error `AuthenticationRequired`. [#72753](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72753) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support `Dynamic` type in functions `ifNull` and `coalesce`. [#72772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72772) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support `Dynamic` in functions `toFloat64`/`touInt32`/etc. [#72989](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72989) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add S3 request settings `http_max_fields`, `http_max_field_name_size`, `http_max_field_value_size` and use them while parsing S3 API responses during making a backup or restoring. [#72778](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72778) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Delete table metadata in keeper in Storage S3(Azure)Queue only after last table using this metadata was dropped. [#72810](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72810) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Added `JoinBuildTableRowCount`/`JoinProbeTableRowCount/JoinResultRowCount` profile events. [#72842](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72842) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Support subcolumns in MergeTree sorting key and skip indexes. [#72644](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72644) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Fix possible intersecting parts for MergeTree (after an operation of moving part to the detached directory has been failed, possibly due to operation on object storage). [#70476](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70476) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fixes an error detection when a table name is too long. Provide a diagnostic telling the maximum length. Add a new function `getMaxTableNameLengthForDatabase`. [#70810](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70810) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Fixed zombie processes after a crash of `clickhouse-library-bridge` (this program allows to run unsafe libraries). [#71301](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71301) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* Fix NoSuchKey error during transaction rollback when creating a directory fails for the `plain_rewritable` disk. [#71439](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71439) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).

* Add inferred format name to create query in `File`/`S3`/`URL`/`HDFS`/`Azure` engines. Previously the format name was inferred each time the server was restarted, and if the specified data files were removed, it led to errors during server startup. [#72108](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72108) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix bugs when using a UDF in join on expression with the old analyzer. [#72179](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72179) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

* Fix a bug where `min_age_to_force_merge_on_partition_only` was getting stuck trying to merge down the same partition repeatedly that was already merged to a single part and not merging partitions that had multiple parts. [#72209](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72209) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Fixed a crash in `SimpleSquashingChunksTransform` that occurred in rare cases when processing sparse columns. [#72226](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72226) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Fixed data race in `GraceHashJoin` as the result of which some rows might be missing in the join output. [#72233](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72233) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Fixed `ALTER DELETE` queries with materialized `_block_number` column (if setting `enable_block_number_column` is enabled). [#72261](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72261) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fixed data race when `ColumnDynamic::dumpStructure()` is called concurrently e.g., in `ConcurrentHashJoin` constructor. [#72278](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72278) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).

* Fix advanced SSL configuration for Keeper's internal communication. [#72730](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72730) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Fix "No such key" error in S3Queue unordered mode with `tracked_files_limit` setting smaller than s3 files appearance rate. [#72738](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72738) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

* Fix potential crash during backup restore. [#72947](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72947) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fixed bug in `parallel_hash` JOIN method that might appear when query has complex condition in the `ON` clause with inequality filters. [#72993](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72993) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Use default format settings during JSON parsing to avoid broken deserialization. [#73043](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73043) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix crash in transactions with unsupported storage. [#73045](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73045) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Fix possible overestimation of memory tracking (when the difference between `MemoryTracking` and `MemoryResident` kept growing). [#73081](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73081) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Check for duplicate JSON keys during Tuple parsing. Previously it could lead to a logical error `Invalid number of rows in Chunk` during parsing. [#73082](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73082) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* All small utilities previously stored in `/utils` folder and required manual compilation from sources are now a part of main ClickHouse bundle. This closes: [#72404](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72404). [#72426](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72426) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Get rid of `/etc/systemd/system/clickhouse-server.service` removal introduced in 22.3 [#39323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39323). [#72259](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72259) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Split large translation units to avoid compilation failures due to memory/cpu limitations. [#72352](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72352) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* OSX: Build with ICU support, which enables collations, charset conversions and other localization features. [#73083](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73083) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).


### <a id="2411"></a> ClickHouse release 24.11, 2024-11-26

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Remove system tables `generate_series` and `generateSeries`. They were added by mistake here: [#59390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59390). [#71091](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71091) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove `StorageExternalDistributed`. Closes [#70600](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70600).[#71176](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71176) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* The table engines Kafka, NATS and RabbitMQ are now covered by their own grants in the `SOURCES` hierarchy. Add grants to any non-default database users that create tables with these engine types. [#71250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71250) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Check the full mutation query before executing it (including subqueries). This prevents accidentally running an invalid query and building up dead mutations that block valid mutations. [#71300](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71300) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Rename filesystem cache setting `skip_download_if_exceeds_query_cache` to `filesystem_cache_skip_download_if_exceeds_per_query_cache_write_limit`. [#71578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71578) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Remove support for `Enum` as well as `UInt128` and `UInt256` arguments in `deltaSumTimestamp`. Remove support for `Int8`, `UInt8`, `Int16`, and `UInt16` of the second ("timestamp") argument of `deltaSumTimestamp`. [#71790](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71790) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* When retrieving data directly from a dictionary using Dictionary storage, dictionary table function, or direct SELECT from the dictionary itself, it is now enough to have `SELECT` permission or `dictGet` permission for the dictionary. This aligns with previous attempts to prevent ACL bypasses: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57362 and https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65359. It also makes the latter one backward compatible. [#72051](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72051) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

#### Experimental feature
* Implement `allow_feature_tier` as a global switch to disable all experimental / beta features. [#71841](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71841) [#71145](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71145) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Fix possible error `No such file or directory` due to unescaped special symbols in files for JSON subcolumns. [#71182](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71182) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support alter from String to JSON. This PR also changes the serialization of JSON and Dynamic types to new version V2. Old version V1 can be still used by enabling setting `merge_tree_use_v1_object_and_dynamic_serialization` (can be used during upgrade to be able to rollback the version without issues). [#70442](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70442) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Implement simple CAST from Map/Tuple/Object to new JSON through serialization/deserialization from JSON string. [#71320](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71320) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Don't allow Variant/Dynamic types in ORDER BY/GROUP BY/PARTITION BY/PRIMARY KEY by default because it may lead to unexpected results. [#69731](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69731) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Forbid Dynamic/Variant types in min/max functions to avoid confusion. [#71761](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71761) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### New Feature
* Added SQL syntax to describe workload and resource management. https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/workload-scheduling. [#69187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69187) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* A new data type, `BFloat16`, represents 16-bit floating point numbers with 8-bit exponent, sign, and 7-bit mantissa. This closes [#44206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44206). This closes [#49937](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49937). [#64712](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64712) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add `CHECK GRANT` query to check whether the current user/role has been granted the specific privilege and whether the corresponding table/column exists in the memory. [#68885](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68885) ([Unalian](https://github.com/Unalian)).
* Add `iceberg[S3;HDFS;Azure]Cluster`, `deltaLakeCluster`, `hudiCluster` table functions. [#72045](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72045) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
* Add ability to set user/password in http_handlers (for `dynamic_query_handler`/`predefined_query_handler`). [#70725](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70725) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add support for staleness clause in the ORDER BY WITH FILL operator. [#71151](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71151) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
* Allow each authentication method to have its own expiration date, remove from user entity. [#70090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70090) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Added new functions `parseDateTime64`, `parseDateTime64OrNull` and `parseDateTime64OrZero`. Compared to the existing function `parseDateTime` (and variants), they return a value of type `DateTime64` instead of `DateTime`. [#71581](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71581) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Optimized memory usage for values of index granularity if granularity is constant for part. Added an ability to always select constant granularity for part (setting `use_const_adaptive_granularity`), which helps to ensure that it is always optimized in memory. It helps in large workloads (trillions of rows in shared storage) to avoid constantly growing memory usage by metadata (values of index granularity) of data parts. [#71786](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71786) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Now we don't copy input blocks columns for `join_algorithm = 'parallel_hash'` when distribute them between threads for parallel processing. [#67782](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67782) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Optimized `Replacing` merge algorithm for non-intersecting parts. [#70977](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70977) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Do not list detached parts from readonly and write-once disks for metrics and system.detached_parts. [#71086](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71086) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Do not calculate heavy asynchronous metrics by default. The feature was introduced in [#40332](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40332), but it isn't good to have a heavy background job that is needed for only a single customer. [#71087](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71087) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* For the `plain_rewritable` disks: Do not call the object storage API when listing directories, as this may be cost-inefficient. Instead, store the list of filenames in the memory. The trade-offs are increased initial load time and memory required to store filenames. [#70823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70823) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Improve the performance and accuracy of `system.query_metric_log` collection interval by reducing the critical region. [#71473](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71473) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
* Read-in-order optimization via generating virtual rows, so less data would be read during merge sort especially useful when multiple parts exist. [#62125](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62125) ([Shichao Jin](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Added server setting `async_load_system_database` that allows the server to start with not fully loaded system database. This helps to start ClickHouse faster if there are many system tables. [#69847](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69847) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Add `--threads` parameter to `clickhouse-compressor`, which allows to compress data in parallel. [#70860](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70860) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added a setting `prewarm_mark_cache` which enables loading of marks to mark cache on inserts, merges, fetches of parts and on startup of the table. [#71053](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71053) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Shrink to fit index_granularity array in memory to reduce memory footprint for MergeTree table engines family. [#71595](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71595) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Turn off filesystem cache setting `boundary_alignment` for non-disk read, which improves performance of reading from standalone remote files with caching. [#71827](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71827) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Queries like `SELECT * FROM table LIMIT ...` used to load part indexes even though they were not used. [#71866](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71866) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Enable `parallel_replicas_local_plan` by default. Building a full-fledged local plan on the query initiator improves parallel replicas performance with less resource consumption, provides opportunities to apply more query optimizations. [#70171](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70171) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).

#### Improvement
* Allow using clickhouse with a file argument as `ch queries.sql`. [#71589](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71589) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* The `Vertical` format (which is also activated when you end your query with `\G`) gets the features of Pretty formats, such as: - highlighting thousand groups in numbers; - printing a readable number tip. [#71630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71630) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Push external user roles from query originator to other nodes in cluster. Helpful when only originator has access to the external authenticator (like LDAP). [#70332](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70332) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Added aliases `anyRespectNulls`, `firstValueRespectNulls`, and `anyValueRespectNulls` for aggregation function `any`. Also added aliases `anyLastRespectNulls` and `lastValueRespectNulls` for aggregation function `anyLast`. This allows using more natural camel-case-only syntax rather than mixed camel-case/underscore syntax, for example: `SELECT anyLastRespectNullsStateIf` instead of `anyLast_respect_nullsStateIf`. [#71403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71403) ([Peter Nguyen](https://github.com/petern48)).
* Added the configuration `date_time_utc` parameter, enabling JSON log formatting to support UTC date-time in RFC 3339/ISO8601 format. [#71560](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71560) ([Ali](https://github.com/xogoodnow)).
* Added a new header type for S3 endpoints for user authentication (`access_header`). This allows to get some access header with the lowest priority, which will be overwritten with `access_key_id` from any other source (for example, a table schema or a named collection). [#71011](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71011) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* Higher-order functions with constant arrays and constant captured arguments will return constants. [#58400](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58400) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Query plan step names (`EXPLAIN PLAN json=1`) and pipeline processor names (`EXPLAIN PIPELINE compact=0,graph=1`) now have a unique id as a suffix. This allows to match processors profiler output and OpenTelemetry traces with explain output. [#63518](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63518) ([qhsong](https://github.com/qhsong)).
* Added option to check if the object exists after writing it to Azure Blob Storage, this is controlled by setting `check_objects_after_upload`. [#64847](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64847) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Use `Atomic` database by default in `clickhouse-local`. Address items 1 and 5 from [#50647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50647). Closes [#44817](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44817). [#68024](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68024) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Exceptions break the HTTP protocol in order to alert the client about error. [#68800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68800) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Report hosts running distributed DDL queries by creating replica_dir and mark replicas active in DDLWorker. [#69658](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69658) ([tuanpach](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* Wait only on active replicas for database ON CLUSTER queries if distributed_ddl_output_mode is set to be *_only_active. [#69660](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69660) ([tuanpach](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* Better error-handling and cancellation of `ON CLUSTER` backups and restores: - If a backup or restore fails on one host then it'll be cancelled on other hosts automatically - No weird errors must be produced because some hosts failed while other hosts continued their work - If a backup or restore is cancelled on one host then it'll be cancelled on other hosts automatically - Fix issues with `test_disallow_concurrency` - now disabling of concurrency must work better - Backups and restores now are much more resistant to ZooKeeper disconnects. [#70027](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70027) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY/RESET SETTING ...` for certain settings in storage S3Queue. [#70811](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70811) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Added the ability to reload client certificates in the same way as the procedure for reloading server certificates. [#70997](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70997) ([Roman Antonov](https://github.com/Romeo58rus)).
* Make the client history size configurable and increase its default size. [#71014](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71014) ([Jiří Kozlovský](https://github.com/jirislav)).
* Boolean types support for the parquet native reader. [#71055](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71055) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Retry more errors when interacting with S3, such as "Malformed message". [#71088](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71088) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Lower log level for some messages about S3. [#71090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71090) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support writing HDFS files with spaces. [#71105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71105) ([exmy](https://github.com/exmy)).
* Added settings limiting the number of replicated tables, dictionaries and views. [#71179](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71179) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* Use `AWS_CONTAINER_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN_FILE` instead of `AWS_CONTAINER_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN` if former is available. Fixes [#71074](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71074). [#71269](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71269) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Remove the metadata_version ZooKeeper node creation from ReplicatedMergeTree restarting thread. The only scenario where we need to create this node is when the user updated from a version earlier than 20.4 straight to one later than 24.10. ClickHouse does not support upgrades that span more than a year, so we should throw an exception and ask the user to update gradually, instead of creating the node. [#71385](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71385) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Add per host dashboards `Overview (host)` and `Cloud overview (host)` to advanced dashboard. [#71422](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71422) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* `clickhouse-local` uses implicit SELECT by default, which allows to use it as a calculator. Improve the syntax highlighting for the implicit SELECT mode. [#71620](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71620) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The command line applications will highlight syntax even for multi-statements. [#71622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71622) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Command-line applications will return non-zero exit codes on errors. In previous versions, the `disks` application returned zero on errors, and other applications returned zero for errors 256 (`PARTITION_ALREADY_EXISTS`) and 512 (`SET_NON_GRANTED_ROLE`). [#71623](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71623) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* When user/group is given as ID, the `clickhouse su` fails. This patch fixes it to accept `UID:GID` as well. [#71626](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71626) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Allow to disable memory buffer increase for filesystem cache via setting `filesystem_cache_prefer_bigger_buffer_size`. [#71640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71640) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add a separate setting `background_download_max_file_segment_size` for background download max file segment size in filesystem cache. [#71648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71648) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Slightly better JSON type parsing: if current block for the JSON path contains values of several types, try to choose the best type by trying types in special best-effort order. [#71785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71785) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Previously reading from `system.asynchronous_metrics` would wait for concurrent update to finish. This can take long time if system is under heavy load. With this change the previously collected values can always be read. [#71798](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71798) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* S3Queue and AzureQueue: Set `polling_max_timeout_ms` to 10 minutes, `polling_backoff_ms` to 30 seconds. [#71817](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71817) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Update `HostResolver` three times in a `history` period. [#71863](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71863) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* On the advanced dashboard HTML page added a dropdown selector for the dashboard from `system.dashboards` table. [#72081](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72081) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Check if default database is present after authorization. Fixes [#71097](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71097). [#71140](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71140) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).

* Fix `AT_* is out of range` problem when running on Oracle Linux UEK 6.10. [#71109](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71109) ([Örjan Fors](https://github.com/op)).
* Fix wrong value in system.query_metric_log due to unexpected race condition. [#71124](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71124) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).

* Fixed case when `s3`/`s3Cluster` functions could return incomplete result or throw an exception. It involved using glob pattern in s3 uri (like `pattern/*`) and an empty object should exist with the key `pattern/` (such objects automatically created by S3 Console). Also default value for setting `s3_skip_empty_files` changed from `false` to `true` by default. [#71947](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71947) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Fix a crash in clickhouse-client syntax highlighting. Closes [#71864](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71864). [#71949](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71949) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).

* Fix formatting of `MOVE PARTITION ... TO TABLE ...` alter commands when `format_alter_commands_with_parentheses` is enabled. [#72080](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72080) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Fixes RIGHT / FULL joins in queries with parallel replicas. Now, RIGHT joins can be executed with parallel replicas (right table reading is distributed). FULL joins can't be parallelized among nodes, - executed locally. [#71162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71162) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Fix the issue where ClickHouse in Docker containers printed "get_mempolicy: Operation not permitted" into stderr due to restricted syscalls. [#70900](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70900) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Fix the metadata_version record in ZooKeeper in restarting thread rather than in attach thread. [#70297](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70297) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* This is a fix for "zero-copy" replication, which is unsupported and will be removed entirely. Don't delete a blob when there are nodes using it in ReplicatedMergeTree with zero-copy replication. [#71186](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71186) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* This is a fix for "zero-copy" replication, which is unsupported and will be removed entirely. Acquiring zero-copy shared lock before moving a part to zero-copy disk to prevent possible data loss if Keeper is unavailable. [#71845](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71845) ([Aleksei Filatov](https://github.com/aalexfvk)).

### <a id="2410"></a> ClickHouse release 24.10, 2024-10-31

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Allow to write `SETTINGS` before `FORMAT` in a chain of queries with `UNION` when subqueries are inside parentheses. This closes [#39712](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39712). Change the behavior when a query has the SETTINGS clause specified twice in a sequence. The closest SETTINGS clause will have a preference for the corresponding subquery. In the previous versions, the outermost SETTINGS clause could take a preference over the inner one. [#68614](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68614) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Reordering of filter conditions from `[PRE]WHERE` clause is now allowed by default. It could be disabled by setting `allow_reorder_prewhere_conditions` to `false`. [#70657](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70657) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Remove the `idxd-config` library, which has an incompatible license. This also removes the experimental Intel DeflateQPL codec. [#70987](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70987) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### New Feature
* Allow to grant access to the wildcard prefixes. `GRANT SELECT ON db.table_pefix_* TO user`. [#65311](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65311) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* If you press space bar during query runtime, the client will display a real-time table with detailed metrics. You can enable it globally with the new `--progress-table` option in clickhouse-client; a new `--enable-progress-table-toggle` is associated with the `--progress-table` option, and toggles the rendering of the progress table by pressing the control key (Space). [#63689](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63689) ([Maria Khristenko](https://github.com/mariaKhr)), [#70423](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70423) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Allow to cache read files for object storage table engines and data lakes using hash from ETag + file path as cache key. [#70135](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70135) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Support creating a table with a query: `CREATE TABLE ... CLONE AS ...`. It clones the source table's schema and then attaches all partitions to the newly created table. This feature is only supported with tables of the `MergeTree` family Closes [#65015](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65015). [#69091](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69091) ([tuanpach](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* Add a new system table, `system.query_metric_log` which contains history of memory and metric values from table system.events for individual queries, periodically flushed to disk. [#66532](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66532) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
* A simple SELECT query can be written with implicit SELECT to enable calculator-style expressions, e.g., `ch "1 + 2"`. This is controlled by a new setting, `implicit_select`. [#68502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68502) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support the `--copy` mode for clickhouse local as a shortcut for format conversion [#68503](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68503). [#68583](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68583) ([Denis Hananein](https://github.com/denis-hananein)).
* Add a builtin HTML page for visualizing merges which is available at the `/merges` path. [#70821](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70821) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add support for `arrayUnion` function. [#68989](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68989) ([Peter Nguyen](https://github.com/petern48)).
* Allow parametrised SQL aliases. [#50665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50665) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* A new aggregate function `quantileExactWeightedInterpolated`, which is a interpolated version based on quantileExactWeighted. Some people may wonder why we need a new `quantileExactWeightedInterpolated` since we already have `quantileExactInterpolatedWeighted`. The reason is the new one is more accurate than the old one. This is for spark compatibility. [#69619](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69619) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* A new function `arrayElementOrNull`. It returns `NULL` if the array index is out of range or a Map key not found. [#69646](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69646) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Allows users to specify regular expressions through new `message_regexp` and `message_regexp_negative` fields in the `config.xml` file to filter out logging. The logging is applied to the formatted un-colored text for the most intuitive developer experience. [#69657](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69657) ([Peter Nguyen](https://github.com/petern48)).
* Added `RIPEMD160` function, which computes the RIPEMD-160 cryptographic hash of a string. Example: `SELECT HEX(RIPEMD160('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'))` returns `37F332F68DB77BD9D7EDD4969571AD671CF9DD3B`. [#70087](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70087) ([Dergousov Maxim](https://github.com/m7kss1)).
* Support reading `Iceberg` tables on `HDFS`. [#70268](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70268) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Support for CTE in the form of `WITH ... INSERT`, as previously we only supported `INSERT ... WITH ...`. [#70593](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70593) ([Shichao Jin](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* MongoDB integration: support for all MongoDB types, support for WHERE and ORDER BY statements on MongoDB side, restriction for expressions unsupported by MongoDB. Note that the new inegration is disabled by default, to use it, please set `<use_legacy_mongodb_integration>` to `false` in server config. [#63279](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63279) ([Kirill Nikiforov](https://github.com/allmazz)).
* A new function `getSettingOrDefault` added to return the default value and avoid exception if a custom setting is not found in the current profile. [#69917](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69917) ([Shankar](https://github.com/shiyer7474)).

#### Experimental feature
* Refreshable materialized views are production ready. [#70550](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70550) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)). Refreshable materialized views are now supported in Replicated databases. [#60669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60669) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Parallel replicas are moved from experimental to beta. Reworked settings that control the behavior of parallel replicas algorithms. A quick recap: ClickHouse has four different algorithms for parallel reading involving multiple replicas, which is reflected in the setting `parallel_replicas_mode`, the default value for it is `read_tasks` Additionally, the toggle-switch setting `enable_parallel_replicas` has been added. [#63151](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63151) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)), ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Support for the `Dynamic` type in most functions by executing them on internal types inside `Dynamic`. [#69691](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69691) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow to read/write the `JSON` type as a binary string in `RowBinary` format under settings `input_format_binary_read_json_as_string/output_format_binary_write_json_as_string`. [#70288](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70288) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow to serialize/deserialize `JSON` column as single String column in the Native format. For output use setting `output_format_native_write_json_as_string`. For input, use serialization version `1` before the column data. [#70312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70312) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Introduced a special (experimental) mode of a merge selector for MergeTree tables which makes it more aggressive for the partitions that are close to the limit by the number of parts. It is controlled by the `merge_selector_use_blurry_base` MergeTree-level setting. [#70645](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70645) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Implement generic ser/de between Avro's `Union` and ClickHouse's `Variant` types. Resolves [#69713](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69713). [#69712](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69712) ([Jiří Kozlovský](https://github.com/jirislav)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Refactor `IDisk` and `IObjectStorage` for better performance. Tables from `plain` and `plain_rewritable` object storages will initialize faster. [#68146](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68146) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov), [Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)). Do not call the LIST object storage API when determining if a file or directory exists on the plain rewritable disk, as it can be cost-inefficient. [#70852](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70852) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)). Reduce the number of object storage HEAD API requests in the plain_rewritable disk. [#70915](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70915) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Added an ability to parse data directly into sparse columns. [#69828](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69828) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improved performance of parsing formats with high number of missed values (e.g. `JSONEachRow`). [#69875](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69875) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Supports parallel reading of parquet row groups and prefetching of row groups in single-threaded mode. [#69862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69862) ([LiuNeng](https://github.com/liuneng1994)).
* Support minmax index for `pointInPolygon`. [#62085](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62085) ([JackyWoo](https://github.com/JackyWoo)).
* Use bloom filters when reading Parquet files. [#62966](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62966) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Lock-free parts rename to avoid INSERT affect SELECT (due to parts lock) (under normal circumstances with `fsync_part_directory`, QPS of SELECT with INSERT in parallel, increased 2x, under heavy load the effect is even bigger). Note, this only includes `ReplicatedMergeTree` for now. [#64955](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64955) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Respect `ttl_only_drop_parts` on `materialize ttl`; only read necessary columns to recalculate TTL and drop parts by replacing them with an empty one. [#65488](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65488) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Optimized thread creation in the ThreadPool to minimize lock contention. Thread creation is now performed outside of the critical section to avoid delays in job scheduling and thread management under high load conditions. This leads to a much more responsive ClickHouse under heavy concurrent load. [#68694](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68694) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Enable reading `LowCardinality` string columns from `ORC`. [#69481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69481) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Use `LowCardinality` for `ProfileEvents` in system logs such as `part_log`, `query_views_log`, `filesystem_cache_log`. [#70152](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70152) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improve performance of `fromUnixTimestamp`/`toUnixTimestamp` functions. [#71042](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71042) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Don't disable nonblocking read from page cache for the entire server when reading from a blocking I/O. This was leading to a poorer performance when a single filesystem (e.g., tmpfs) didn't support the `preadv2` syscall while others do. [#70299](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70299) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* `ALTER TABLE .. REPLACE PARTITION` doesn't wait anymore for mutations/merges that happen in other partitions. [#59138](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59138) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk)).
* Don't do validation when synchronizing ACL from Keeper. It's validating during creation. It shouldn't matter that much, but there are installations with tens of thousands or even more user created, and the unnecessary hash validation can take a long time to finish during server startup (it synchronizes everything from keeper). [#70644](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70644) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

#### Improvement
* `CREATE TABLE AS` will copy `PRIMARY KEY`, `ORDER BY`, and similar clauses (of `MergeTree` tables). [#69739](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69739) ([sakulali](https://github.com/sakulali)).

* Command-line arguments for Bool settings are set to true when no value is provided for the argument (e.g. `clickhouse-client --optimize_aggregation_in_order --query "SELECT 1"`). [#70459](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70459) ([davidtsuk](https://github.com/davidtsuk)).
* Added user-level settings `min_free_disk_bytes_to_perform_insert` and `min_free_disk_perform_to_throw_insert` to prevent insertions on disks that are almost full. [#69755](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69755) ([Marco Vilas Boas](https://github.com/marco-vb)).
* Embedded documentation for settings will be strictly more detailed and complete than the documentation on the website. This is the first step before making the website documentation always auto-generated from the source code. This has long-standing implications: - it will be guaranteed to have every setting; - there is no chance of having default values obsolete; - we can generate this documentation for each ClickHouse version; - the documentation can be displayed by the server itself even without Internet access. Generate the docs on the website from the source code. [#70289](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70289) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow empty needle in the function `replace`, the same behavior with PostgreSQL. [#69918](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69918) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Allow empty needle in functions `replaceRegexp*`. [#70053](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70053) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Symbolic links for tables in the `data/database_name/` directory are created for the actual paths to the table's data, depending on the storage policy, instead of the `store/...` directory on the default disk. [#61777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61777) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* While parsing an `Enum` field from `JSON`, a string containing an integer will be interpreted as the corresponding `Enum` element. This closes [#65119](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65119). [#66801](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66801) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).

* Add `show_create_query_identifier_quoting_rule` to define identifier quoting behavior in the `SHOW CREATE TABLE` query result. Possible values: - `user_display`: When the identifiers is a keyword. - `when_necessary`: When the identifiers is one of `{"distinct", "all", "table"}` and when it could lead to ambiguity: column names, dictionary attribute names. - `always`: Always quote identifiers. [#69448](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69448) ([tuanpach](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* Improve restoring of access entities' dependencies [#69563](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69563) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* If you run `clickhouse-client` or other CLI application, and it starts up slowly due to an overloaded server, and you start typing your query, such as `SELECT`, the previous versions will display the remaining of the terminal echo contents before printing the greetings message, such as `SELECTClickHouse local version 24.10.1.1.` instead of `ClickHouse local version 24.10.1.1.`. Now it is fixed. This closes [#31696](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31696).

### <a id="249"></a> ClickHouse release 24.9, 2024-09-26

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Expressions like `a[b].c` are supported for named tuples, as well as named subscripts from arbitrary expressions, e.g., `expr().name`. This is useful for processing JSON. This closes [#54965](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/54965). In previous versions, an expression of form `expr().name` was parsed as `tupleElement(expr(), name)`, and the query analyzer was searching for a column `name` rather than for the corresponding tuple element; while in the new version, it is changed to `tupleElement(expr(), 'name')`. In most cases, the previous version was not working, but it is possible to imagine a very unusual scenario when this change could lead to incompatibility: if you stored names of tuple elements in a column or an alias, that was named differently than the tuple element's name: `SELECT 'b' AS a, CAST([tuple(123)] AS 'Array(Tuple(b UInt8))') AS t, t[1].a`. It is very unlikely that you used such queries, but we still have to mark this change as potentially backward incompatible. [#68435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68435) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* When the setting `print_pretty_type_names` is enabled, it will print `Tuple` data type in a pretty form in `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statements, `formatQuery` function, and in the interactive mode in `clickhouse-client` and `clickhouse-local`. In previous versions, this setting was only applied to `DESCRIBE` queries and `toTypeName`. This closes [#65753](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65753). [#68492](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68492) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Do not allow explicitly specifying UUID when creating a table in `Replicated` databases. Also, do not allow explicitly specifying Keeper path and replica name for *MergeTree tables in Replicated databases. It introduces a new setting `database_replicated_allow_explicit_uuid` and changes the type of `database_replicated_allow_replicated_engine_arguments` from Bool to UInt64 [#66104](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66104) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

#### New Feature
* Allow a user to have multiple authentication methods instead of only one. Allow authentication methods to be reset to most recently added method. If you want to run instances on 24.8 and one on 24.9 for some time, it's better to set `max_authentication_methods_per_user` = 1 for that period to avoid potential incompatibilities. [#65277](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65277) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Add support for `ATTACH PARTITION ALL FROM`. [#61987](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61987) ([Kirill Nikiforov](https://github.com/allmazz)).
* Add the `input_format_json_empty_as_default` setting which, when enabled, treats empty fields in JSON inputs as default values. Closes [#59339](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59339). [#66782](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66782) ([Alexis Arnaud](https://github.com/a-a-f)).
* Added functions `overlay` and `overlayUTF8` which replace parts of a string by another string. Example: `SELECT overlay('Hello New York', 'Jersey', 11)` returns `Hello New Jersey`. [#66933](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66933) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add support for lightweight deletes in partition `DELETE FROM [db.]table [ON CLUSTER cluster] [IN PARTITION partition_expr] WHERE expr; ` [#67805](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67805) ([sunny](https://github.com/sunny19930321)).
* Implemented comparison for `Interval` data type values of different domains (such as seconds and minutes) so they are converting now to the least supertype. [#68057](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68057) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Add `create_if_not_exists` setting to default to `IF NOT EXISTS` behavior during CREATE statements. [#68164](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68164) ([Peter Nguyen](https://github.com/petern48)).
* Makes it possible to read `Iceberg` tables in Azure and locally. [#68210](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68210) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Query cache entries can now be dropped by tag. For example, the query cache entry created by `SELECT 1 SETTINGS use_query_cache = true, query_cache_tag = 'abc'` can now be dropped by `SYSTEM DROP QUERY CACHE TAG 'abc'`. [#68477](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68477) ([Michał Tabaszewski](https://github.com/pinsvin00)).
* Add storage encryption for named collections. [#68615](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68615) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
* Add virtual column `_headers` for the `URL` table engine. Closes [#65026](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65026). [#68867](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68867) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Add `system.projections` table to track available projections. [#68901](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68901) ([Jordi Villar](https://github.com/jrdi)).
* Add new function `arrayZipUnaligned` for spark compatibility (which is named `arrays_zip` in Spark), which allowed unaligned arrays based on original `arrayZip`. [#69030](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69030) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Added `cp`/`mv` commands for the keeper client command line application which atomically copies/moves node. [#69034](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69034) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
* Adds argument `scale` (default: `true`) to function `arrayAUC` which allows to skip the normalization step (issue [#69609](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69609)). [#69717](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69717) ([gabrielmcg44](https://github.com/gabrielmcg44)).

#### Experimental feature
* Adds a setting `input_format_try_infer_variants` which allows `Variant` type to be inferred during schema inference for text formats when there is more than one possible type for column/array elements. [#63798](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63798) ([Shaun Struwig](https://github.com/Blargian)).
* Add aggregate functions `distinctDynamicTypes`/`distinctJSONPaths`/`distinctJSONPathsAndTypes` for better introspection of JSON column type content. [#68463](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68463) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* New algorithm to determine the unit of marks distribution between parallel replicas by a consistent hash. Different numbers of marks chosen for different read patterns to improve performance. [#68424](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68424) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Previously the algorithmic complexity of part deduplication logic in parallel replica announcement handling was O(n^2) which could take noticeable time for tables with many part (or partitions). This change makes the complexity O(n*log(n)). [#69596](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69596) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Refreshable materialized view improvements: append mode (`... REFRESH EVERY 1 MINUTE APPEND ...`) to add rows to existing table instead of overwriting the whole table, retries (disabled by default, configured in SETTINGS section of the query), `SYSTEM WAIT VIEW <name>` query that waits for the currently running refresh, some fixes. [#58934](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58934) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Added `min_max`as a new type of (experimental) statistics. It supports estimating range predicates over numeric columns, e.g. `x < 100`. [#67013](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67013) ([JackyWoo](https://github.com/JackyWoo)).
* Improve castOrDefault from Variant/Dynamic columns so it works when inner types are not convertable at all. [#67150](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67150) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Replication of subset of columns is now available through MaterializedPostgreSQL. Closes [#33748](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33748). [#69092](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69092) ([Kruglov Kirill](https://github.com/1on)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Implemented reading of required files only for Hive partitioning. [#68963](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68963) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Improve the JOIN performance by rearranging the right table by keys while the table keys are dense in the LEFT or INNER hash joins. [#60341](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60341) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Improve ALL JOIN performance by appending the list of rows lazily. [#63677](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63677) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Load filesystem cache metadata asynchronously during the boot process, in order to make restarts faster (controlled by setting `load_metadata_asynchronously`). [#65736](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65736) ([Daniel Pozo Escalona](https://github.com/danipozo)).
* Functions `array` and `map` were optimized to process certain common cases much faster. [#67707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67707) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Trivial optimize on ORC strings reading especially when a column contains no NULLs. [#67794](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67794) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improved overall performance of merges by reducing the overhead of scheduling steps of merges. [#68016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68016) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Speed up requests to S3 when a profile is not set, credentials are not set, and IMDS is not available (for example, when you are querying a public bucket on a machine outside of a cloud). This closes [#52771](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/52771). [#68082](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68082) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Devirtualize format reader in `RowInputFormatWithNamesAndTypes` for some performance improvement. [#68437](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68437) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add the parallel merge for `uniq` aggregate function when aggregating with a group by key to maximize the CPU utilization. [#68441](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68441) ([Jiebin Sun](https://github.com/jiebinn)).
* Add settings `output_format_orc_dictionary_key_size_threshold` to allow user to enable dict encoding for string column in `ORC` output format. It helps reduce the output `ORC` file size and improve reading performance significantly. [#68591](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68591) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Introduce new Keeper request RemoveRecursive which removes node with all it's subtree. [#69332](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69332) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
* Speedup insertion performance into a table with a vector similarity index by adding data to the vector index in parallel. [#69493](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69493) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Reduce memory usage of inserts to JSON by using adaptive write buffer size. A lot of files created by JSON column in wide part contains small amount of data and it doesn't make sense to allocate 1MB buffer for them. [#69272](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69272) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Avoid returning a thread in the concurrent hash join threadpool to avoid query excessively spawn threads. [#69406](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69406) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).

#### Improvement
* CREATE TABLE AS now copies PRIMARY KEY, ORDER BY, and similar clauses. Now it supports only for MergeTree family of table engines. [#69076](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69076) ([sakulali](https://github.com/sakulali)).
* Hardened parts of the codebase related to parsing of small entities. The following (minor) bugs were found and fixed: - if a `DeltaLake` table is partitioned by Bool, the partition value is always interpreted as false; - `ExternalDistributed` table was using only a single shard in the provided addresses; the value of `max_threads` setting and similar were printed as `'auto(N)'` instead of `auto(N)`. [#52503](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/52503) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Use cgroup-specific metrics for CPU usage accounting instead of system-wide metrics. [#62003](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62003) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* IO scheduling for remote S3 disks is now done on the level of HTTP socket streams (instead of the whole S3 requests) to resolve `bandwidth_limit` throttling issues. [#65182](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65182) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Functions `upperUTF8` and `lowerUTF8` were previously only able to uppercase / lowercase Cyrillic characters. This limitation is now removed and characters in arbitrary languages are uppercased/lowercased. Example: `SELECT upperUTF8('Süden')` now returns `SÜDEN`. [#65761](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65761) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* When lightweight delete happens on a table with projection(s), despite users have choices either throw an exception (by default) or drop the projection when the lightweight delete would happen, now there is the third option to still have lightweight delete and then rebuild projection(s). [#66169](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66169) ([jsc0218](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Two options (`dns_allow_resolve_names_to_ipv4` and `dns_allow_resolve_names_to_ipv6`) have been added, to allow block connections ip family. [#66895](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66895) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* Make Ctrl-Z ignorance configurable (ignore_shell_suspend) in clickhouse-client. [#67134](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67134) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Improve UTF-8 validation in JSON output formats. Ensures that valid JSON is generated in the case of certain byte sequences in the result data. [#67938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67938) ([mwoenker](https://github.com/mwoenker)).
* Added profile events for merges and mutations for better introspection. [#68015](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68015) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* ODBC: get http_max_tries from the server configuration. [#68128](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68128) ([Rodolphe Dugé de Bernonville](https://github.com/RodolpheDuge)).
* Add wildcard support for user identification in X.509 SubjectAltName extension. [#68236](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68236) ([Marco Vilas Boas](https://github.com/marco-vb)).
* Improve schema inference of date times. Now `DateTime64` used only when date time has fractional part, otherwise regular DateTime is used. Inference of Date/DateTime is more strict now, especially when `date_time_input_format='best_effort'` to avoid inferring date times from strings in corner cases. [#68382](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68382) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Delete old code of named collections from dictionaries and substitute it to the new, which allows to use DDL created named collections in dictionaries. Closes [#60936](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60936), closes [#36890](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36890). [#68412](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68412) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Use HTTP/1.1 instead of HTTP/1.0 (set by default) for external HTTP authenticators. [#68456](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68456) ([Aleksei Filatov](https://github.com/aalexfvk)).
* Added a new set of metrics for thread pool introspection, providing deeper insights into thread pool performance and behavior. [#68674](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68674) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Support query parameters in async inserts with format `Values`. [#68741](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68741) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Support `Date32` on `dateTrunc` and `toStartOfInterval`. [#68874](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68874) ([LiuNeng](https://github.com/liuneng1994)).
* Add `plan_step_name` and `plan_step_description` columns to `system.processors_profile_log`. [#68954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68954) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).

* Add CPU arch to the short fault information message. [#69037](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69037) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Queries will fail faster if a new Keeper connection cannot be established during retries. [#69148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69148) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Update Database Factory so it would be possible for user defined database engines to have arguments, settings and table overrides (similar to StorageFactory). [#69201](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69201) ([NikBarykin](https://github.com/NikBarykin)).
* Restore mode that replaces all external table engines and functions to the `Null` engine (`restore_replace_external_engines_to_null`, `restore_replace_external_table_functions_to_null` settings) was failing if table had SETTINGS. Now it removes settings from table definition in this case and allows to restore such tables. [#69253](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69253) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD is correctly escaped for XML in clickhouse image's entrypoint. [#69301](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69301) ([aohoyd](https://github.com/aohoyd)).
* Allow empty arguments for `arrayZip`/`arrayZipUnaligned`, as concat did in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65887. It is for spark compatiability in Gluten CH Backend. [#69576](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69576) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Support more advanced SSL options for Keeper's internal communication (e.g. private keys with passphrase). [#69582](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69582) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Index analysis can take noticeable time for big tables with many parts or partitions. This change should enable killing a heavy query at that stage. [#69606](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69606) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Masking sensitive info in `gcs` table function. [#69611](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69611) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Rebuild projection for merges that reduce number of rows. [#62364](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62364) ([cangyin](https://github.com/cangyin)).

* Fixed error on generated columns in the experimental and totally unsupported MaterializedPostgreSQL engine when adnum ordering is broken [#63161](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/63161). Fixed error on id column with nextval expression as default in the experimental and totally unsupported MaterializedPostgreSQL when there are generated columns in table. Fixed error on dropping publication with symbols except \[a-z1-9-\]. [#67664](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67664) ([Kruglov Kirill](https://github.com/1on)).
* Storage Join to support Nullable columns in the left table, close [#61247](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61247). [#66926](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66926) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Incorrect query result with parallel replicas (distribute queries as well) when `IN` operator contains conversion to Decimal(). The bug was introduced with the new analyzer. [#67234](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67234) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Fix the problem that alter modify order by causes inconsistent metadata. [#67436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67436) ([iceFireser](https://github.com/iceFireser)).
* Fix the upper bound of the function `fromModifiedJulianDay`. It was supposed to be `9999-12-31` but was mistakenly set to `9999-01-01`. [#67583](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67583) ([PHO](https://github.com/depressed-pho)).
* Fix when the index is not at the beginning of the tuple during `IN` query. [#67626](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67626) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Fix expiration in `RoleCache`. [#67748](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67748) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Fix window view missing blocks due to slow flush to view. [#67983](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67983) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Fix MSan issue caused by incorrect date format. [#68105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68105) ([JackyWoo](https://github.com/JackyWoo)).
* Fixed crash in Parquet filtering when data types in the file substantially differ from requested types (e.g. `... FROM file('a.parquet', Parquet, 'x String')`, but the file has `x Int64`). Without this fix, use `input_format_parquet_filter_push_down = 0` as a workaround. [#68131](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68131) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).

* Try fix postgres crash when query is cancelled. [#68288](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68288) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* After https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61984 `schema_inference_make_columns_nullable=0` still can make columns `Nullable` in Parquet/Arrow formats. The change was backward incompatible and users noticed the changes in the behaviour. This PR makes `schema_inference_make_columns_nullable=0` to work as before (no Nullable columns will be inferred) and introduces new value `auto` for this setting that will make columns `Nullable` only if data has information about nullability. [#68298](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68298) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fixes [#50868](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50868). Small DateTime64 constant values returned by a nested subquery inside a distributed query were wrongly transformed to Nulls, thus causing errors and possible incorrect query results. [#68323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68323) ([Shankar](https://github.com/shiyer7474)).

* Fix Progress column value of system.view_refreshes greater than 1 [#68377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68377). [#68378](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68378) ([megao](https://github.com/jetgm)).
* Process regexp flags correctly. [#68389](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68389) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* PostgreSQL-style cast operator (`::`) works correctly even for SQL-style hex and binary string literals (e.g., `SELECT x'414243'::String`). This closes [#68324](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68324). [#68482](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68482) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Minor patch for https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68131. [#68494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68494) ([Chang chen](https://github.com/baibaichen)).
* Fix [#68239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68239) SAMPLE n where n is an integer. [#68499](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68499) ([Denis Hananein](https://github.com/denis-hananein)).

* After unexpected restart, fail to start replication of ReplicatedMergeTree due to abnormal handling of covered-by-broken part. [#68584](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68584) ([baolin](https://github.com/baolinhuang)).
* Fix `LOGICAL_ERROR`s when functions `sipHash64Keyed`, `sipHash128Keyed`, or `sipHash128ReferenceKeyed` are applied to empty arrays or tuples. [#68630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68630) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Full text index may filter out wrong columns when index multiple columns, it didn't reset row_id between different columns, the reproduce procedure is in tests/queries/0_stateless/03228_full_text_with_multi_col.sql. Without this. [#68644](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68644) ([siyuan](https://github.com/linkwk7)).
* Fix invalid character '\t' and '\n' in replica_name when creating a Replicated table, which causes incorrect parsing of 'source replica' in LogEntry.

* This change addresses an issue where attempting to create a Replicated database again after a server failure during the initial creation process could result in error. [#69102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69102) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Don't infer Bool type from String in CSV when `input_format_csv_try_infer_numbers_from_strings = 1` because we don't allow reading bool values from strings. [#69109](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69109) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Fix the INFILE format detection for asynchronous inserts. If the format is not explicitly defined in the FORMAT clause, it can be detected from the INFILE file extension. [#69237](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69237) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* After [this issue](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59946#issuecomment-1943653197) there are quite a few table replicas in production such that their `metadata_version` node value is both equal to `0` and is different from the respective table's `metadata` node version. This leads to `alter` queries failing on such replicas. [#69274](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69274) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Mark Dynamic type as not safe primary key type to avoid issues with Fields. [#69311](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69311) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Close [#69135](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69135). If we try to reuse joined data for `cross` join, but this could not happen in ClickHouse at present. It's better to keep `have_compressed` in `reuseJoinedData`. [#69404](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69404) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Make `materialize()` function return full column when parameter is a sparse column. [#69429](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69429) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).

* Fixed case when memory consumption was too high because of the squashing in `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` or `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` queries. [#69469](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69469) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Statements `SHOW COLUMNS` and `SHOW INDEX` now work properly if the table has dots in its name. [#69514](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69514) ([Salvatore Mesoraca](https://github.com/aiven-sal)).
* Usage of the query cache for queries with an overflow mode != 'throw' is now disallowed. This prevents situations where potentially truncated and incorrect query results could be stored in the query cache. (issue [#67476](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/67476)). [#69549](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69549) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Keep original order of conditions during move to prewhere. Previously the order could change and it could lead to failing queries when the order is important. [#69560](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69560) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix Keeper multi-request preprocessing after ZNOAUTH error. [#69627](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69627) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).

* Fix `StorageS3(Azure)Queue` settings `tracked_file_ttl_sec`. We wrote it to keeper with key `tracked_file_ttl_sec`, but read as `tracked_files_ttl_sec`, which was a typo. [#69742](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69742) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Use tryconvertfieldtotype in gethyperrectangleforrowgroup. [#69745](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69745) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Revert "Fix prewhere without columns and without adaptive index granularity (almost w/o anything)"'. Due to the reverted changes some errors might happen when reading data parts produced by old CH releases (presumably 2021 or older). [#68897](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68897) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).


### <a id="248"></a> ClickHouse release 24.8 LTS, 2024-08-20

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* `clickhouse-client` and `clickhouse-local` now default to multi-query mode (instead single-query mode). As an example, `clickhouse-client -q "SELECT 1; SELECT 2"` now works, whereas users previously had to add `--multiquery` (or `-n`). The `--multiquery/-n` switch became obsolete. INSERT queries in multi-query statements are treated specially based on their FORMAT clause: If the FORMAT is `VALUES` (the most common case), the end of the INSERT statement is represented by a trailing semicolon `;` at the end of the query. For all other FORMATs (e.g. `CSV` or `JSONEachRow`), the end of the INSERT statement is represented by two newlines `\n\n` at the end of the query. [#63898](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63898) ([FFish](https://github.com/wxybear)).
* In previous versions, it was possible to use an alternative syntax for `LowCardinality` data types by appending `WithDictionary` to the name of the data type. It was an initial working implementation, and it was never documented or exposed to the public. Now, it is deprecated. If you have used this syntax, you have to ALTER your tables and rename the data types to `LowCardinality`. [#66842](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66842) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix logical errors with storage `Buffer` used with distributed destination table. It's a backward incompatible change: queries using `Buffer` with a distributed destination table may stop working if the table appears more than once in the query (e.g., in a self-join). [#67015](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67015) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* In previous versions, calling functions for random distributions based on the Gamma function (such as Chi-Squared, Student, Fisher) with negative arguments close to zero led to a long computation or an infinite loop. In the new version, calling these functions with zero or negative arguments will produce an exception. This closes [#67297](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/67297). [#67326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67326) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The system table `text_log` is enabled by default. This is fully compatible with previous versions, but you may notice subtly increased disk usage on the local disk (this system table takes a tiny amount of disk space). [#67428](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67428) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* In previous versions, `arrayWithConstant` can be slow if asked to generate very large arrays. In the new version, it is limited to 1 GB per array. This closes [#32754](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32754). [#67741](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67741) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix REPLACE modifier formatting (forbid omitting brackets). [#67774](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67774) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Backported in [#68349](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68349): Reimplement `Dynamic` type. Now when the limit of dynamic data types is reached new types are not cast to String but stored in a special data structure in binary format with binary encoded data type. Now any type ever inserted into `Dynamic` column can be read from it as subcolumn. [#68132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68132) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### New Feature
* Added a new `MergeTree` setting `deduplicate_merge_projection_mode` to control the projections during merges (for specific engines) and `OPTIMIZE DEDUPLICATE` query. Supported options: `throw` (throw an exception in case the projection is not fully supported for *MergeTree engine), `drop` (remove projection during merge if it can't be merged itself consistently) and `rebuild` (rebuild projection from scratch, which is a heavy operation). [#66672](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66672) ([jsc0218](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Add `_etag` virtual column for S3 table engine. Fixes [#65312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65312). [#65386](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65386) ([skyoct](https://github.com/skyoct)).
* Added a tagging (namespace) mechanism for the query cache. The same queries with different tags are considered different by the query cache. Example: `SELECT 1 SETTINGS use_query_cache = 1, query_cache_tag = 'abc'` and `SELECT 1 SETTINGS use_query_cache = 1, query_cache_tag = 'def'` now create different query cache entries. [#68235](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68235) ([sakulali](https://github.com/sakulali)).
* Support more variants of JOIN strictness (`LEFT/RIGHT SEMI/ANTI/ANY JOIN`) with inequality conditions which involve columns from both left and right table. e.g. `t1.y < t2.y` (see the setting `allow_experimental_join_condition`). [#64281](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64281) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Interpret Hive-style partitioning for different engines (`File`, `URL`, `S3`, `AzureBlobStorage`, `HDFS`). Hive-style partitioning organizes data into partitioned sub-directories, making it efficient to query and manage large datasets. Currently, it only creates virtual columns with the appropriate name and data. The follow-up PR will introduce the appropriate data filtering (performance speedup). [#65997](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65997) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Add function `printf` for Spark compatiability (but you can use the existing `format` function). [#66257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66257) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add options `restore_replace_external_engines_to_null` and `restore_replace_external_table_functions_to_null` to replace external engines and table_engines to `Null` engine that can be useful for testing. It should work for RESTORE and explicit table creation. [#66536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66536) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Added support for reading `MULTILINESTRING` geometry in `WKT` format using function `readWKTLineString`. [#67647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67647) ([Jacob Reckhard](https://github.com/jacobrec)).
* Add a new table function `fuzzQuery`. This function allows the modification of a given query string with random variations. Example: `SELECT query FROM fuzzQuery('SELECT 1') LIMIT 5;`. [#67655](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67655) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Add a query `ALTER TABLE ... DROP DETACHED PARTITION ALL` to drop all detached partitions. [#67885](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67885) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Add the `rows_before_aggregation_at_least` statistic to the query response when a new setting, `rows_before_aggregation` is enabled. This statistic represents the number of rows read before aggregation. In the context of a distributed query, when using the `group by` or `max` aggregation function without a `limit`, `rows_before_aggregation_at_least` can reflect the number of rows hit by the query. [#66084](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66084) ([morning-color](https://github.com/morning-color)).
* Support `OPTIMIZE` query on `Join` tables to reduce their memory footprint. [#67883](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67883) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Allow run query instantly in play if you add `&run=1` in the URL [#66457](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66457) ([Aleksandr Musorin](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Implement a new `JSON` data type. [#66444](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66444) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add the new `TimeSeries` table engine. [#64183](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64183) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add new experimental `Kafka` storage engine to store offsets in Keeper instead of relying on committing them to Kafka. It makes the commit to ClickHouse tables atomic with regard to consumption from the queue. [#57625](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57625) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Use adaptive read task size calculation method (adaptive meaning it depends on read column sizes) for parallel replicas. [#60377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60377) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Added statistics type `count_min` (count-min sketches) which provide selectivity estimations for equality predicates like `col = 'val'`. Supported data types are string, date, datatime and numeric types. [#65521](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65521) ([JackyWoo](https://github.com/JackyWoo)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Setting `optimize_functions_to_subcolumns` is enabled by default. [#68053](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68053) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Store the `plain_rewritable` disk directory metadata in `__meta` layout, separately from the merge tree data in the object storage. Move the `plain_rewritable` disk to a flat directory structure. [#65751](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65751) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Improve columns squashing (an operation happening in INSERT queries) for `String`/`Array`/`Map`/`Variant`/`Dynamic` types by reserving required memory in advance for all subcolumns. [#67043](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67043) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Speed up `SYSTEM FLUSH LOGS` and flush logs on shutdown. [#67472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67472) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Improved overall performance of merges by reducing the overhead of the scheduling steps of merges. [#68016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68016) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Speed up tables removal for `DROP DATABASE` query, increased the default value for `database_catalog_drop_table_concurrency` to 16. [#67228](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67228) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Avoid allocating too much capacity for array column while writing ORC. Performance speeds up 15% for an Array column. [#67879](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67879) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Speed up mutations for non-replicated MergeTree significantly [#66911](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66911) [#66909](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66909) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Improvement
* Setting `allow_experimental_analyzer` is renamed to `enable_analyzer`. The old name is preserved in a form of an alias. This signifies that Analyzer is no longer in beta and is fully promoted to production. [#66438](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66438) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Improve schema inference of date times. Now DateTime64 used only when date time has fractional part, otherwise regular DateTime is used. Inference of Date/DateTime is more strict now, especially when `date_time_input_format='best_effort'` to avoid inferring date times from strings in corner cases. [#68382](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68382) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* ClickHouse server now supports new setting `max_keep_alive_requests`. For keep-alive HTTP connections to the server it works in tandem with `keep_alive_timeout` - if idle timeout not expired but there already more than `max_keep_alive_requests` requests done through the given connection - it will be closed by the server. [#61793](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61793) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Various improvements in the advanced dashboard. This closes [#67697](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/67697). This closes [#63407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/63407). This closes [#51129](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/51129). This closes [#61204](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61204). [#67701](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67701) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Do not require a grant for REMOTE when creating a Distributed table: a grant for the Distributed engine is enough. [#65419](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65419) ([jsc0218](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Do not pass logs for keeper explicitly in the Docker image to allow overriding. [#65564](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65564) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Introduced `use_same_password_for_base_backup` settings for `BACKUP` and `RESTORE` queries, allowing to create and restore incremental backups to/from password protected archives. [#66214](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66214) ([Samuele](https://github.com/sguerrini97)).
* Ignore `async_load_databases` for `ATTACH` query (previously it was possible for ATTACH to return before the tables had been attached). [#66240](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66240) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added logs and metrics for rejected connections (where there are not enough resources). [#66410](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66410) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Support proper `UUID` type for MongoDB engine. [#66671](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66671) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add replication lag and recovery time metrics. [#66703](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66703) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Add `DiskS3NoSuchKeyErrors` metric. [#66704](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66704) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Ensure the `COMMENT` clause works for all table engines. [#66832](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66832) ([Joe Lynch](https://github.com/joelynch)).
* Function `mapFromArrays` now accepts `Map(K, V)` as first argument, for example: `SELECT mapFromArrays(map('a', 4, 'b', 4), ['aa', 'bb'])` now works and returns `{('a',4):'aa',('b',4):'bb'}`. Also, if the 1st argument is an Array, it can now also be of type `Array(Nullable(T))` or `Array(LowCardinality(Nullable(T)))` as long as the actual array values are not `NULL`. [#67103](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67103) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Read configuration for `clickhouse-local` from `~/.clickhouse-local`. [#67135](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67135) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Rename setting `input_format_orc_read_use_writer_time_zone` to `input_format_orc_reader_timezone` and allow the user to set the reader timezone. [#67175](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67175) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Decrease level of the `Socket is not connected` error when HTTP connection immediately reset by peer after connecting, close [#34218](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34218). [#67177](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67177) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Add ability to load dashboards for `system.dashboards` from config (once set, they overrides the default dashboards preset). [#67232](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67232) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* The window functions in SQL are traditionally in snake case. ClickHouse uses `camelCase`, so new aliases `denseRank()` and `percentRank()` have been created. These new functions can be called the exact same as the original `dense_rank()` and `percent_rank()` functions. Both snake case and camelCase syntaxes remain usable. A new test for each of the functions has been added as well. This closes [#67042](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/67042) . [#67334](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67334) ([Peter Nguyen](https://github.com/petern48)).
* Autodetect configuration file format if is not `.xml`, `.yml` or `.yaml`. If the file begins with &lt; it might be XML, otherwise it might be YAML. It is useful when providing a configuration file from a pipe: `clickhouse-server --config-file <(echo "hello: world")`. [#67391](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67391) ([sakulali](https://github.com/sakulali)).
* Functions `formatDateTime` and `formatDateTimeInJodaSyntax` now treat their format parameter as optional. If it is not specified, format strings `%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s` and `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` are assumed. Example: `SELECT parseDateTime('2021-01-04 23:12:34')` now returns DateTime value `2021-01-04 23:12:34` (previously, this threw an exception). [#67399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67399) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Automatically retry Keeper requests in KeeperMap if they happen because of timeout or connection loss. [#67448](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67448) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add `-no-pie` to Aarch64 Linux builds to allow proper introspection and symbolizing of stacktraces after a ClickHouse restart. [#67916](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67916) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Added profile events for merges and mutations for better introspection. [#68015](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68015) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Remove unnecessary logs for non-replicated `MergeTree`. [#68238](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68238) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Integration tests flaky check will not run each test case multiple times to find more issues in tests and make them more reliable. It is using `pytest-repeat` library to run test case multiple times for the same environment. It is important to cleanup tables and other entities in the end of a test case to pass. Repeating works much faster than several pytest runs as it starts necessary containers only once. [#66986](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66986) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Unblock the usage of CLion with ClickHouse. In previous versions, CLion freezed for a minute on every keypress. This closes [#66994](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/66994). [#66995](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66995) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* getauxval: avoid a crash under a sanitizer re-exec due to high ASLR entropy in newer Linux kernels. [#67081](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67081) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Some parts of client code are extracted to a single file and highest possible level optimization is applied to them even for debug builds. This closes: [#65745](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65745). [#67215](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67215) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

[#67654](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67654) ([Shankar](https://github.com/shiyer7474)).
* Fix crash on `percent_rank`. `percent_rank`'s default frame type is changed to `range unbounded preceding and unbounded following`. `IWindowFunction`'s default window frame is considered and now window functions without window frame definition in sql can be put into different `WindowTransfomer`s properly.

* Now ClickHouse doesn't consider part as broken if projection doesn't exist on disk but exists in `checksums.txt`. [#68003](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68003) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Fixed skipping of untouched parts in mutations with new analyzer. Previously with enabled analyzer data in part could be rewritten by mutation even if mutation doesn't affect this part according to predicate. [#68052](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68052) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Removes an incorrect optimization to remove sorting in subqueries that use `OFFSET`. Fixes [#67906](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/67906). [#68099](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68099) ([Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell)).

* Change how deduplication for Materialized Views works. Fixed a lot of cases like: - on destination table: data is split for 2 or more blocks and that blocks is considered as duplicate when that block is inserted in parallel. - on MV destination table: the equal blocks are deduplicated, that happens when MV often produces equal data as a result for different input data due to performing aggregation. - on MV destination table: the equal blocks which comes from different MV are deduplicated. [#61601](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61601) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Functions `bitShiftLeft` and `bitShitfRight` return an error for out of bounds shift positions [#65838](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65838) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).

* Change binary serialization of the `Variant` data type: add `compact` mode to avoid writing the same discriminator multiple times for granules with single variant or with only NULL values. Add MergeTree setting `use_compact_variant_discriminators_serialization` that is enabled by default. Note that Variant type is still experimental and backward-incompatible change in serialization is ok. [#62774](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62774) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support on-disk backend storage for clickhouse-keeper. [#56626](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/56626) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Refactor JSONExtract functions, support more types including experimental Dynamic type. [#66046](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66046) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support null map subcolumn for `Variant` and `Dynamic` subcolumns. [#66178](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66178) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix reading `Dynamic` subcolumns from altered `Memory` table. Previously if `max_types` parameter of a Dynamic type was changed in Memory table via alter, further subcolumns reading can return wrong result. [#66066](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66066) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add support for `cluster_for_parallel_replicas` when using custom key parallel replicas. It allows you to use parallel replicas with custom key with MergeTree tables. [#65453](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65453) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Replace int to string algorithm with a faster one (from a modified amdn/itoa to a modified jeaiii/itoa). [#61661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61661) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Sizes of hash tables created by join (`parallel_hash` algorithm) are collected and cached now. This information will be used to preallocate space in hash tables for subsequent query executions and save time on hash table resizes. [#64553](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64553) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Optimized queries with `ORDER BY` primary key and `WHERE` that have a condition with high selectivity by using buffering. It is controlled by setting `read_in_order_use_buffering` (enabled by default) and can increase memory usage of query. [#64607](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64607) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improve performance of loading `plain_rewritable` metadata. [#65634](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65634) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Attaching tables on read-only disks will use fewer resources by not loading outdated parts. [#65635](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65635) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support minmax hyperrectangle for Set indices. [#65676](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65676) ([AntiTopQuark](https://github.com/AntiTopQuark)).
* Unload primary index of outdated parts to reduce total memory usage. [#65852](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65852) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Functions `replaceRegexpAll` and `replaceRegexpOne` are now significantly faster if the pattern is trivial, i.e. contains no metacharacters, pattern classes, flags, grouping characters etc. (Thanks to Taiyang Li). [#66185](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66185) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* s3 requests: Reduce retry time for queries, increase retries count for backups. 8.5 minutes and 100 retires for queries, 1.2 hours and 1000 retries for backup restore. [#65232](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65232) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Support query plan LIMIT optimization. Support LIMIT pushdown for PostgreSQL storage and table function. [#65454](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65454) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improved ZooKeeper load balancing. The current session doesn't expire until the optimal nodes become available despite `fallback_session_lifetime`. Added support for AZ-aware balancing. [#65570](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65570) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* DatabaseCatalog drops tables faster by using up to database_catalog_drop_table_concurrency threads. [#66065](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66065) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).

#### Improvement
* Improved ZooKeeper load balancing. The current session doesn't expire until the optimal nodes become available despite `fallback_session_lifetime`. Added support for AZ-aware balancing. [#65570](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65570) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* The setting `optimize_trivial_insert_select` is disabled by default. In most cases, it should be beneficial. Nevertheless, if you are seeing slower INSERT SELECT or increased memory usage, you can enable it back or `SET compatibility = '24.6'`. [#58970](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58970) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Print stacktrace and diagnostic info if `clickhouse-client` or `clickhouse-local` crashes. [#61109](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61109) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* The result of `SHOW INDEX | INDEXES | INDICES | KEYS` was previously sorted by the primary key column names. Since this was unintuitive, the result is now sorted by the position of the primary key columns within the primary key. [#61131](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61131) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Change how deduplication for Materialized Views works. Fixed a lot of cases like: - on destination table: data is split for 2 or more blocks and that blocks is considered as duplicate when that block is inserted in parallel. - on MV destination table: the equal blocks are deduplicated, that happens when MV often produces equal data as a result for different input data due to performing aggregation. - on MV destination table: the equal blocks which comes from different MV are deduplicated. [#61601](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61601) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Support reading partitioned data DeltaLake data. Infer DeltaLake schema by reading metadata instead of data. [#63201](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63201) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* In composable protocols TLS layer accepted only `certificateFile` and `privateKeyFile` parameters. https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/composable-protocols. [#63985](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63985) ([Anton Ivashkin](https://github.com/ianton-ru)).
* Added profile event `SelectQueriesWithPrimaryKeyUsage` which indicates how many SELECT queries use the primary key to evaluate the WHERE clause. [#64492](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64492) ([0x01f](https://github.com/0xfei)).
* `StorageS3Queue` related fixes and improvements. Deduce a default value of `s3queue_processing_threads_num` according to the number of physical cpu cores on the server (instead of the previous default value as 1). Set default value of `s3queue_loading_retries` to 10. Fix possible vague "Uncaught exception" in exception column of `system.s3queue`. Do not increment retry count on `MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` exception. Move files commit to a stage after insertion into table fully finished to avoid files being commited while not inserted. Add settings `s3queue_max_processed_files_before_commit`, `s3queue_max_processed_rows_before_commit`, `s3queue_max_processed_bytes_before_commit`, `s3queue_max_processing_time_sec_before_commit`, to better control commit and flush time. [#65046](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65046) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Support aliases in parametrized view function (only new analyzer). [#65190](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65190) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Updated to mask account key in logs in azureBlobStorage. [#65273](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65273) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Partition pruning for `IN` predicates when filter expression is a part of `PARTITION BY` expression. [#65335](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65335) ([Eduard Karacharov](https://github.com/korowa)).
* `arrayMin`/`arrayMax` can be applicable to all data types that are comparable. [#65455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65455) ([pn](https://github.com/chloro-pn)).
* Improved memory accounting for cgroups v2 to exclude the amount occupied by the page cache. [#65470](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65470) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Do not create format settings for each row when serializing chunks to insert to EmbeddedRocksDB table. [#65474](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65474) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Reduce `clickhouse-local` prompt to just `:)`. `getFQDNOrHostName()` takes too long on macOS, and we don't want a hostname in the prompt for `clickhouse-local` anyway. [#65510](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65510) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Avoid printing a message from jemalloc about per-CPU arenas on low-end virtual machines. [#65532](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65532) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Disable filesystem cache background download by default. It will be enabled back when we fix the issue with possible "Memory limit exceeded" because memory deallocation is done outside of query context (while buffer is allocated inside of query context) if we use background download threads. Plus we need to add a separate setting to define max size to download for background workers (currently it is limited by max_file_segment_size, which might be too big). [#65534](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65534) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add new option to config `<config_reload_interval_ms>` which allow to specify how often clickhouse will reload config. [#65545](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65545) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Implement binary encoding for ClickHouse data types and add its specification in docs. Use it in Dynamic binary serialization, allow to use it in RowBinaryWithNamesAndTypes and Native formats under settings. [#65546](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65546) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Server settings `compiled_expression_cache_size` and `compiled_expression_cache_elements_size` are now shown in `system.server_settings`. [#65584](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65584) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Add support for user identification based on x509 SubjectAltName extension. [#65626](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65626) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* `clickhouse-local` will respect the `max_server_memory_usage` and `max_server_memory_usage_to_ram_ratio` from the configuration file. It will also set the max memory usage to 90% of the system memory by default, like `clickhouse-server` does. [#65697](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65697) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a script to backup your files to ClickHouse. [#65699](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65699) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* PostgreSQL source to support query cancellations. [#65722](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65722) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Make `allow_experimental_analyzer` be controlled by the initiator for distributed queries. This ensures compatibility and correctness during operations in mixed version clusters. [#65777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65777) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Respect cgroup CPU limit in Keeper. [#65819](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65819) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Allow to use `concat` function with empty arguments `:) select concat();`. [#65887](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65887) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Allow controlling named collections in `clickhouse-local`. [#65973](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65973) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improve Azure-related profile events. [#65999](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65999) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Support ORC file read by writer's time zone. [#66025](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66025) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Add settings to control connections to PostgreSQL. The setting `postgresql_connection_attempt_timeout` specifies the value passed to `connect_timeout` parameter of connection URL. The setting `postgresql_connection_pool_retries` specifies the number of retries to establish a connection to the PostgreSQL end-point. [#66232](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66232) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Reduce inaccuracy of `input_wait_elapsed_us`/`elapsed_us` in the `system.processors_profile_log`. [#66239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66239) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Improve ProfileEvents for the filesystem cache. [#66249](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66249) ([zhukai](https://github.com/nauu)).
* Add settings to ignore the `ON CLUSTER` clause in queries for named collection management with the replicated storage. [#66288](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66288) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* Function `generateSnowflakeID` now allows to specify a machine ID as a parameter to prevent collisions in large clusters. [#66374](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66374) ([ZAWA_ll](https://github.com/Zawa-ll)).
* Disable suspending on `Ctrl+Z` in interactive mode. This is a common trap and is not expected behavior for almost all users. I imagine only a few extreme power users could appreciate suspending terminal applications to the background, but I don't know any. [#66511](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66511) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add option for validating the primary key type in Dictionaries. Without this option for simple layouts any column type will be implicitly converted to UInt64. [#66595](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66595) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Check cyclic dependencies on CREATE/REPLACE/RENAME/EXCHANGE queries and throw an exception if there is a cyclic dependency. Previously such cyclic dependencies could lead to a deadlock during server startup. Also fix some bugs in dependencies creation. [#65405](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65405) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* `Query was cancelled` might have been printed twice in clickhouse-client. This behaviour is fixed. [#66005](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66005) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Fixed crash while using `MaterializedMySQL` (which is an unsupported, experimental feature) with TABLE OVERRIDE that maps MySQL NULL field into ClickHouse not NULL field. [#54649](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/54649) ([Filipp Ozinov](https://github.com/bakwc)).
* Fix logical error when `PREWHERE` expression read no columns and table has no adaptive index granularity (very old table). [#59173](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59173) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).

* Fix crash on destroying AccessControl: add explicit shutdown. [#64993](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64993) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Eliminate injective function in argument of functions `uniq*` recursively. This used to work correctly but was broken in the new analyzer. [#65140](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65140) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Fix unexpected projection name when query with CTE. [#65267](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65267) ([wudidapaopao](https://github.com/wudidapaopao)).
* Require `dictGet` privilege when accessing dictionaries via direct query or the `Dictionary` table engine. [#65359](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65359) ([Joe Lynch](https://github.com/joelynch)).
* Fix user-specific S3 auth with incremental backups. [#65481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65481) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Disable `non-intersecting-parts` optimization for queries with `FINAL` in case of `read-in-order` optimization was enabled. This could lead to an incorrect query result. As a workaround, disable `do_not_merge_across_partitions_select_final` and `split_parts_ranges_into_intersecting_and_non_intersecting_final` before this fix is merged. [#65505](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65505) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Fix getting exception `Index out of bound for blob metadata` in case all files from list batch were filtered out. [#65523](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65523) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fix NOT_FOUND_COLUMN_IN_BLOCK for deduplicate merge of projection. [#65573](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65573) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Fixed bug in MergeJoin. Column in sparse serialisation might be treated as a column of its nested type though the required conversion wasn't performed. [#65632](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65632) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Fixed a bug that compatibility level '23.4' was not properly applied. [#65737](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65737) ([cw5121](https://github.com/cw5121)).
* Fix odbc table with nullable fields. [#65738](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65738) ([Rodolphe Dugé de Bernonville](https://github.com/RodolpheDuge)).

* Fix invalid exceptions in function `parseDateTime` with `%F` and `%D` placeholders. [#65768](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65768) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* For queries that read from `PostgreSQL`, cancel the internal `PostgreSQL` query if the ClickHouse query is finished. Otherwise, `ClickHouse` query cannot be canceled until the internal `PostgreSQL` query is finished. [#65771](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65771) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Fix a bug in short circuit logic when old analyzer and dictGetOrDefault is used. [#65802](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65802) ([jsc0218](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Fix a bug leads to EmbeddedRocksDB with TTL write corrupted SST files. [#65816](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65816) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Functions `bitTest`, `bitTestAll`, and `bitTestAny` now return an error if the specified bit index is out-of-bounds [#65818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65818) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
* Setting `join_any_take_last_row` is supported in any query with hash join. [#65820](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65820) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Better handling of join conditions involving `IS NULL` checks (for example `ON (a = b AND (a IS NOT NULL) AND (b IS NOT NULL) ) OR ( (a IS NULL) AND (b IS NULL) )` is rewritten to `ON a <=> b`), fix incorrect optimization when condition other then `IS NULL` are present. [#65835](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65835) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Fix growing memory usage in S3Queue. [#65839](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65839) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

* Add missing settings `input_format_csv_skip_first_lines/input_format_tsv_skip_first_lines/input_format_csv_try_infer_numbers_from_strings/input_format_csv_try_infer_strings_from_quoted_tuples` in schema inference cache because they can change the resulting schema. It prevents from incorrect result of schema inference with these settings changed. [#65980](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65980) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Column _size in s3 engine and s3 table function denotes the size of a file inside the archive, not a size of the archive itself. [#65993](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65993) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Fix resolving dynamic subcolumns in analyzer, avoid reading the whole column on dynamic subcolumn reading. [#66004](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66004) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix config merging for from_env with replace overrides. [#66034](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66034) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

* Fixed buffer overflow bug in `unbin`/`unhex` implementation. [#66106](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66106) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Disable the `merge-filters` optimization introduced in [#64760](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64760). It may cause an exception if optimization merges two filter expressions and does not apply a short-circuit evaluation. [#66126](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66126) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Fixed the issue when the server failed to parse Avro files with negative block size arrays encoded, which is now allowed by the Avro specification. [#66130](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66130) ([Serge Klochkov](https://github.com/slvrtrn)).
* Fixed a bug in ZooKeeper client: a session could get stuck in unusable state after receiving a hardware error from ZooKeeper. For example, this might happen due to "soft memory limit" in ClickHouse Keeper. [#66140](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66140) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

### <a id="246"></a> ClickHouse release 24.6, 2024-07-01

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Enable asynchronous load of databases and tables by default. See the `async_load_databases` in config.xml. While this change is fully compatible, it can introduce a difference in behavior. When `async_load_databases` is false, as in the previous versions, the server will not accept connections until all tables are loaded. When `async_load_databases` is true, as in the new version, the server can accept connections before all the tables are loaded. If a query is made to a table that is not yet loaded, it will wait for the table's loading, which can take considerable time. It can change the behavior of the server if it is part of a large distributed system under a load balancer. In the first case, the load balancer can get a connection refusal and quickly failover to another server. In the second case, the load balancer can connect to a server that is still loading the tables, and the query will have a higher latency. Moreover, if many queries accumulate in the waiting state, it can lead to a "thundering herd" problem when they start processing simultaneously. This can make a difference only for highly loaded distributed backends. You can set the value of `async_load_databases` to false to avoid this problem. [#57695](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57695) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Setting `replace_long_file_name_to_hash` is enabled by default for `MergeTree` tables. [#64457](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64457) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)). This setting is fully compatible, and no actions needed during upgrade. The new data format is supported from all versions starting from 23.9. After enabling this setting, you can no longer downgrade to a version 23.8 or older.
* Some invalid queries will fail earlier during parsing. Note: disabled the support for inline KQL expressions (the experimental Kusto language) when they are put into a `kql` table function without a string literal, e.g. `kql(garbage | trash)` instead of `kql('garbage | trash')` or `kql($$garbage | trash$$)`. This feature was introduced unintentionally and should not exist. [#61500](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61500) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Rework parallel processing in `Ordered` mode of storage `S3Queue`. This PR is backward incompatible for Ordered mode if you used settings `s3queue_processing_threads_num` or `s3queue_total_shards_num`. Setting `s3queue_total_shards_num` is deleted, previously it was allowed to use only under `s3queue_allow_experimental_sharded_mode`, which is now deprecated. A new setting is added - `s3queue_buckets`. [#64349](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64349) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* New functions `snowflakeIDToDateTime`, `snowflakeIDToDateTime64`, `dateTimeToSnowflakeID`, and `dateTime64ToSnowflakeID` were added. Unlike the existing functions `snowflakeToDateTime`, `snowflakeToDateTime64`, `dateTimeToSnowflake`, and `dateTime64ToSnowflake`, the new functions are compatible with function `generateSnowflakeID`, i.e. they accept the snowflake IDs generated by `generateSnowflakeID` and produce snowflake IDs of the same type as `generateSnowflakeID` (i.e. `UInt64`). Furthermore, the new functions default to the UNIX epoch (aka. 1970-01-01), just like `generateSnowflakeID`. If necessary, a different epoch, e.g. Twitter's/X's epoch 2010-11-04 aka. 1288834974657 msec since UNIX epoch, can be passed. The old conversion functions are deprecated and will be removed after a transition period: to use them regardless, enable setting `allow_deprecated_snowflake_conversion_functions`. [#64948](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64948) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

* Introduced new functions `base64URLEncode`, `base64URLDecode` and `tryBase64URLDecode`. [#64991](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64991) ([Mikhail Gorshkov](https://github.com/mgorshkov)).
* Add new function `editDistanceUTF8`, which calculates the [edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) between two UTF8 strings. [#65269](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65269) ([LiuNeng](https://github.com/liuneng1994)).
* Add `http_response_headers` configuration to support custom response headers in custom HTTP handlers. [#63562](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63562) ([Grigorii](https://github.com/GSokol)).
* Added a new table function `loop` to support returning query results in an infinite loop. [#63452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63452) ([Sariel](https://github.com/sarielwxm)). This is useful for testing.
* Introduced two additional columns in the `system.query_log`: `used_privileges` and `missing_privileges`. `used_privileges` is populated with the privileges that were checked during query execution, and `missing_privileges` contains required privileges that are missing. [#64597](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64597) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Added a setting `output_format_pretty_display_footer_column_names` which when enabled displays column names at the end of the table for long tables (50 rows by default), with the threshold value for minimum number of rows controlled by `output_format_pretty_display_footer_column_names_min_rows`. [#65144](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65144) ([Shaun Struwig](https://github.com/Blargian)).

* Added a new setting, `metadata_keep_free_space_bytes` to keep free space on the metadata storage disk. [#64128](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64128) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* Add metrics to track the number of directories created and removed by the `plain_rewritable` metadata storage, and the number of entries in the local-to-remote in-memory map. [#64175](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64175) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* The query cache now considers identical queries with different settings as different. This increases robustness in cases where different settings (e.g. `limit` or `additional_table_filters`) would affect the query result. [#64205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64205) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Support the non standard error code `QpsLimitExceeded` in object storage as a retryable error. [#64225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64225) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Forbid converting a MergeTree table to replicated if the zookeeper path for this table already exists. [#64244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64244) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* Added a new setting `input_format_parquet_prefer_block_bytes` to control the average output block bytes, and modified the default value of `input_format_parquet_max_block_size` to 65409. [#64427](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64427) ([LiuNeng](https://github.com/liuneng1994)).

* Support the non standard error code `TotalQpsLimitExceeded` in object storage as a retryable error. [#64520](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64520) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Updated Advanced Dashboard for both open-source and ClickHouse Cloud versions to include a chart for 'Maximum concurrent network connections'. [#64610](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64610) ([Thom O'Connor](https://github.com/thomoco)).

[#64842](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64842) ([Unalian](https://github.com/Unalian)).
* Remove mark of `allow_experimental_join_condition` as important. This mark may have prevented distributed queries in a mixed versions cluster from being executed successfully. [#65008](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65008) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Added server Asynchronous metrics `DiskGetObjectThrottler*` and `DiskGetObjectThrottler*` reflecting request per second rate limit defined with `s3_max_get_rps` and `s3_max_put_rps` disk settings and currently available number of requests that could be sent without hitting throttling limit on the disk. Metrics are defined for every disk that has a configured limit. [#65050](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65050) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Initialize global trace collector for `Poco::ThreadPool` (needed for Keeper, etc). [#65239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65239) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

* Returned back the behaviour of how ClickHouse works and interprets Tuples in CSV format. This change effectively reverts https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60994 and makes it available only under a few settings: `output_format_csv_serialize_tuple_into_separate_columns`, `input_format_csv_deserialize_separate_columns_into_tuple` and `input_format_csv_try_infer_strings_from_quoted_tuples`. [#65170](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65170) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

* Fix the output of function `formatDateTimeInJodaSyntax` when a formatter generates an uneven number of characters and the last character is `0`. For example, `SELECT formatDateTimeInJodaSyntax(toDate('2012-05-29'), 'D')` now correctly returns `150` instead of previously `15`. [#64614](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64614) ([LiuNeng](https://github.com/liuneng1994)).
* Do not rewrite aggregation if `-If` combinator is already used. [#64638](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64638) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Fix type inference for float (in case of small buffer, i.e. `--max_read_buffer_size 1`). [#64641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64641) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

* Fix the `Block structure mismatch` error for queries reading with `PREWHERE` from the materialized view when the materialized view has columns of different types than the source table. Fixes [#64611](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64611). [#64855](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64855) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Fix rare crash when table has TTL with subquery + database replicated + parallel replicas + analyzer. It's really rare, but please don't use TTLs with subqueries. [#64858](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64858) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

* This PR ensures that the type of the constant(IN operator's second parameter) is always visible during the IN operator's type conversion process. Otherwise, losing type information may cause some conversions to fail, such as the conversion from DateTime to Date. This fixes ([#64487](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64487)). [#65315](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65315) ([pn](https://github.com/chloro-pn)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Add support for LLVM XRay. [#64592](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64592) [#64837](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64837) ([Tomer Shafir](https://github.com/tomershafir)).
* Unite s3/hdfs/azure storage implementations into a single class working with IObjectStorage. Same for *Cluster, data lakes and Queue storages. [#59767](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59767) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Refactor data part writer to remove dependencies on MergeTreeData and DataPart. [#63620](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63620) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Refactor `KeyCondition` and key analysis to improve PartitionPruner and trivial count optimization. This is separated from [#60463](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60463) . [#61459](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61459) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Introduce assertions to verify all functions are called with columns of the right size. [#63723](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63723) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Make `network` service be required when using the `rc` init script to start the ClickHouse server daemon. [#60650](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60650) ([Chun-Sheng, Li](https://github.com/peter279k)).

### <a id="245"></a> ClickHouse release 24.5, 2024-05-30

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Renamed "inverted indexes" to "full-text indexes" which is a less technical / more user-friendly name. This also changes internal table metadata and breaks tables with existing (experimental) inverted indexes. Please make sure to drop such indexes before upgrade and re-create them after upgrade. [#62884](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62884) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Usage of functions `neighbor`, `runningAccumulate`, `runningDifferenceStartingWithFirstValue`, `runningDifference` deprecated (because it is error-prone). Proper window functions should be used instead. To enable them back, set `allow_deprecated_error_prone_window_functions = 1` or set `compatibility = '24.4'` or lower. [#63132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63132) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Queries from `system.columns` will work faster if there is a large number of columns, but many databases or tables are not granted for `SHOW TABLES`. Note that in previous versions, if you grant `SHOW COLUMNS` to individual columns without granting `SHOW TABLES` to the corresponding tables, the `system.columns` table will show these columns, but in a new version, it will skip the table entirely. Remove trace log messages "Access granted" and "Access denied" that slowed down queries. [#63439](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63439) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### New Feature
* Adds the `Form` format to read/write a single record in the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format. [#60199](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60199) ([Shaun Struwig](https://github.com/Blargian)).
* Added possibility to compress in CROSS JOIN. [#60459](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60459) ([p1rattttt](https://github.com/p1rattttt)).
* Added possibility to do `CROSS JOIN` in temporary files if the size exceeds limits. [#63432](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63432) ([p1rattttt](https://github.com/p1rattttt)).
* Support join with inequal conditions which involve columns from both left and right table. e.g. `t1.y < t2.y`. To enable, `SET allow_experimental_join_condition = 1`. [#60920](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60920) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Maps can now have `Float32`, `Float64`, `Array(T)`, `Map(K, V)` and `Tuple(T1, T2, ...)` as keys. Closes [#54537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/54537). [#59318](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59318) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Introduce bulk loading to `EmbeddedRocksDB` by creating and ingesting SST file instead of relying on rocksdb build-in memtable. This help to increase importing speed, especially for long-running insert query to StorageEmbeddedRocksDB tables. Also, introduce `EmbeddedRocksDB` table settings. [#59163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59163) [#63324](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63324) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* User can now parse CRLF with TSV format using a setting `input_format_tsv_crlf_end_of_line`. Closes [#56257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/56257). [#59747](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59747) ([Shaun Struwig](https://github.com/Blargian)).
* A new setting `input_format_force_null_for_omitted_fields` that forces NULL values for omitted fields. [#60887](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60887) ([Constantine Peresypkin](https://github.com/pkit)).
* Earlier our S3 storage and s3 table function didn't support selecting from archive container files, such as tarballs, zip, 7z. Now they allow to iterate over files inside archives in S3. [#62259](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62259) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Support for conditional function `clamp`. [#62377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62377) ([skyoct](https://github.com/skyoct)).
* Add `NPy` output format. [#62430](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62430) ([豪肥肥](https://github.com/HowePa)).
* `Raw` format as a synonym for `TSVRaw`. [#63394](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63394) ([Unalian](https://github.com/Unalian)).
* Added a new SQL function `generateUUIDv7` to generate version 7 UUIDs aka. timestamp-based UUIDs with random component. Also added a new function `UUIDToNum` to extract bytes from a UUID and a new function `UUIDv7ToDateTime` to extract timestamp component from a UUID version 7. [#62852](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62852) ([Alexey Petrunyaka](https://github.com/pet74alex)).
* On Linux and MacOS, if the program has stdout redirected to a file with a compression extension, use the corresponding compression method instead of nothing (making it behave similarly to `INTO OUTFILE`). [#63662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63662) ([v01dXYZ](https://github.com/v01dXYZ)).
* Change warning on high number of attached tables to differentiate tables, views and dictionaries. [#64180](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64180) ([Francisco J. Jurado Moreno](https://github.com/Beetelbrox)).
* Provide support for `azureBlobStorage` function in ClickHouse server to use Azure Workload identity to authenticate against Azure blob storage. If `use_workload_identity` parameter is set in config, [workload identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity#authenticate-azure-hosted-applications) is used for authentication. [#57881](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57881) ([Vinay Suryadevara](https://github.com/vinay92-ch)).
* Add TTL information in the `system.parts_columns` table. [#63200](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63200) ([litlig](https://github.com/litlig)).

#### Experimental Features
* Implement `Dynamic` data type that allows to store values of any type inside it without knowing all of them in advance. `Dynamic` type is available under a setting `allow_experimental_dynamic_type`. Reference: [#54864](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/54864). [#63058](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63058) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allowed to create `MaterializedMySQL` database without connection to MySQL. [#63397](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63397) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* Automatically mark a replica of Replicated database as lost and start recovery if some DDL task fails more than `max_retries_before_automatic_recovery` (100 by default) times in a row with the same error. Also, fixed a bug that could cause skipping DDL entries when an exception is thrown during an early stage of entry execution. [#63549](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63549) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Account failed files in `s3queue_tracked_file_ttl_sec` and `s3queue_traked_files_limit` for `StorageS3Queue`. [#63638](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63638) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Less contention in filesystem cache (part 4). Allow to keep filesystem cache not filled to the limit by doing additional eviction in the background (controlled by `keep_free_space_size(elements)_ratio`). This allows to release pressure from space reservation for queries (on `tryReserve` method). Also this is done in a lock free way as much as possible, e.g. should not block normal cache usage. [#61250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61250) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Skip merging of newly created projection blocks during `INSERT`-s. [#59405](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59405) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Process string functions `...UTF8` 'asciily' if input strings are all ascii chars. Inspired by https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/29799. Overall speed up by 1.07x~1.62x. Notice that peak memory usage had been decreased in some cases. [#61632](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61632) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improved performance of selection (`{}`) globs in StorageS3. [#62120](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62120) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* HostResolver has each IP address several times. If remote host has several IPs and by some reason (firewall rules for example) access on some IPs allowed and on others forbidden, than only first record of forbidden IPs marked as failed, and in each try these IPs have a chance to be chosen (and failed again).

* Added a rewritable S3 disk which supports INSERT operations and does not require locally stored metadata. [#61116](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61116) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)). The main use case is for system tables.
* The syntax highlighting while typing in the client will work on the syntax level (previously, it worked on the lexer level). [#62123](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62123) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Supports dropping multiple tables at the same time like `DROP TABLE a, b, c`;. [#58705](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58705) ([zhongyuankai](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* Modifying memory table settings through `ALTER MODIFY SETTING` is now supported. Example: `ALTER TABLE memory MODIFY SETTING min_rows_to_keep = 100, max_rows_to_keep = 1000;`. [#62039](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62039) ([zhongyuankai](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* Added `role` query parameter to the HTTP interface. It works similarly to `SET ROLE x`, applying the role before the statement is executed. This allows for overcoming the limitation of the HTTP interface, as multiple statements are not allowed, and it is not possible to send both `SET ROLE x` and the statement itself at the same time. It is possible to set multiple roles that way, e.g., `?role=x&role=y`, which will be an equivalent of `SET ROLE x, y`. [#62669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62669) ([Serge Klochkov](https://github.com/slvrtrn)).
* Add `SYSTEM UNLOAD PRIMARY KEY` to free up memory usage for a table's primary key. [#62738](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62738) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
* Added `value1`, `value2`, ..., `value10` columns to `system.text_log`. These columns contain values that were used to format the message. [#59619](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59619) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Added persistent virtual column `_block_offset` which stores original number of row in block that was assigned at insert. Persistence of column `_block_offset` can be enabled by the MergeTree setting `enable_block_offset_column`. Added virtual column`_part_data_version` which contains either min block number or mutation version of part. Persistent virtual column `_block_number` is not considered experimental anymore. [#60676](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60676) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Add a setting `input_format_json_throw_on_bad_escape_sequence`, disabling it allows saving bad escape sequences in JSON input formats. [#61889](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61889) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Performance Improvement
* JOIN filter push down improvements using equivalent sets. [#61216](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61216) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Convert OUTER JOIN to INNER JOIN optimization if the filter after JOIN always filters default values. Optimization can be controlled with setting `query_plan_convert_outer_join_to_inner_join`, enabled by default. [#62907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62907) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improvement for AWS S3. Client has to send header 'Keep-Alive: timeout=X' to the server. If a client receives a response from the server with that header, client has to use the value from the server. Also for a client it is better not to use a connection which is nearly expired in order to avoid connection close race. [#62249](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62249) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Reduce overhead of the mutations for SELECTs (v2). [#60856](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60856) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* More frequently invoked functions in PODArray are now force-inlined. [#61144](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61144) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Speed up parsing of JSON by skipping the rest of the object when all required columns are read. [#62210](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62210) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Improve trivial insert select from files in file/s3/hdfs/url/... table functions. Add separate max_parsing_threads setting to control the number of threads used in parallel parsing. [#62404](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62404) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Functions `to_utc_timestamp` and `from_utc_timestamp` are now about 2x faster. [#62583](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62583) ([KevinyhZou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Functions `parseDateTimeOrNull`, `parseDateTimeOrZero`, `parseDateTimeInJodaSyntaxOrNull` and `parseDateTimeInJodaSyntaxOrZero` now run significantly faster (10x - 1000x) when the input contains mostly non-parseable values. [#62634](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62634) ([LiuNeng](https://github.com/liuneng1994)).
* SELECTs against `system.query_cache` are now noticeably faster when the query cache contains lots of entries (e.g. more than 100.000). [#62671](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62671) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Less contention in filesystem cache (part 3): execute removal from filesystem without lock on space reservation attempt. [#61163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61163) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Speed up dynamic resize of filesystem cache. [#61723](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61723) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Dictionary source with `INVALIDATE_QUERY` is not reloaded twice on startup. [#62050](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62050) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Fix an issue where when a redundant `= 1` or `= 0` is added after a boolean expression involving the primary key, the primary index is not used. For example, both `SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <primary-key> IN (<value>) = 1` and `SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <primary-key> NOT IN (<value>) = 0` will both perform a full table scan, when the primary index can be used. [#62142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62142) ([josh-hildred](https://github.com/josh-hildred)).
* Return stream of chunks from `system.remote_data_paths` instead of accumulating the whole result in one big chunk. This allows to consume less memory, show intermediate progress and cancel the query. [#62613](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62613) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Support parallel write buffer for Azure Blob Storage managed by setting `azure_allow_parallel_part_upload`. [#62534](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62534) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Userspace page cache works with static web storage (`disk(type = web)`) now. Use client setting `use_page_cache_for_disks_without_file_cache=1` to enable. [#61911](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61911) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Don't treat Bool and number variants as suspicious in the `Variant` type. [#61999](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61999) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Implement better conversion from String to `Variant` using parsing. [#62005](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62005) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support `Variant` in JSONExtract functions. [#62014](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62014) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Mark type `Variant` as comparable so it can be used in primary key. [#62693](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62693) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Improvement
* For convenience purpose, `SELECT * FROM numbers() `will work in the same way as `SELECT * FROM system.numbers` - without a limit. [#61969](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61969) ([YenchangChan](https://github.com/YenchangChan)).
* Introduce separate consumer/producer tags for the Kafka configuration. This avoids warnings from librdkafka (a bad C library with a lot of bugs) that consumer properties were specified for producer instances and vice versa (e.g. `Configuration property session.timeout.ms is a consumer property and will be ignored by this producer instance`). Closes: [#58983](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58983). [#58956](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58956) ([Aleksandr Musorin](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).
* Functions `date_diff` and `age` now calculate their result at nanosecond instead of microsecond precision. They now also offer `nanosecond` (or `nanoseconds` or `ns`) as a possible value for the `unit` parameter. [#61409](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61409) ([Austin Kothig](https://github.com/kothiga)).
* Added nano-, micro-, milliseconds unit for `date_trunc`. [#62335](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62335) ([Misz606](https://github.com/Misz606)).
* Reload certificate chain during certificate reload. [#61671](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61671) ([Pervakov Grigorii](https://github.com/GrigoryPervakov)).
* Try to prevent an error [#60432](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60432) by not allowing a table to be attached if there is an active replica for that replica path. [#61876](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61876) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Implement support for `input` for `clickhouse-local`. [#61923](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61923) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* `Join` table engine with strictness `ANY` is consistent after reload. When several rows with the same key are inserted, the first one will have higher priority (before, it was chosen randomly upon table loading). close [#51027](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/51027). [#61972](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61972) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Automatically infer Nullable column types from Apache Arrow schema. [#61984](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61984) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Allow to cancel parallel merge of aggregate states during aggregation. Example: `uniqExact`. [#61992](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61992) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Use `system.keywords` to fill in the suggestions and also use them in the all places internally. [#62000](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62000) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* `OPTIMIZE FINAL` for `ReplicatedMergeTree` now will wait for currently active merges to finish and then reattempt to schedule a final merge. This will put it more in line with ordinary `MergeTree` behaviour. [#62067](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62067) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* While read data from a hive text file, it would use the first line of hive text file to resize of number of input fields, and sometimes the fields number of first line is not matched with the hive table defined , such as the hive table is defined to have 3 columns, like `test_tbl(a Int32, b Int32, c Int32)`, but the first line of text file only has 2 fields, and in this suitation, the input fields will be resized to 2, and if the next line of the text file has 3 fields, then the third field can not be read but set a default value 0, which is not right. [#62086](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62086) ([KevinyhZou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* `CREATE AS` copies the table's comment. [#62117](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62117) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
* Add query progress to table zookeeper. [#62152](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62152) ([JackyWoo](https://github.com/JackyWoo)).
* Add ability to turn on trace collector (Real and CPU) server-wide. [#62189](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62189) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Added setting `lightweight_deletes_sync` (default value: 2 - wait all replicas synchronously). It is similar to setting `mutations_sync` but affects only behaviour of lightweight deletes. [#62195](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62195) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Distinguish booleans and integers while parsing values for custom settings: `SET custom_a = true; SET custom_b = 1;`. [#62206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62206) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support S3 access through AWS Private Link Interface endpoints. Closes [#60021](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60021), [#31074](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31074) and [#53761](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/53761). [#62208](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62208) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Do not create a directory for UDF in clickhouse-client if it does not exist. This closes [#59597](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59597). [#62366](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62366) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The query cache now no longer caches results of queries against system tables (`system.*`, `information_schema.*`, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.*`). [#62376](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62376) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* `MOVE PARTITION TO TABLE` query can be delayed or can throw `TOO_MANY_PARTS` exception to avoid exceeding limits on the part count. The same settings and limits are applied as for the`INSERT` query (see `max_parts_in_total`, `parts_to_delay_insert`, `parts_to_throw_insert`, `inactive_parts_to_throw_insert`, `inactive_parts_to_delay_insert`, `max_avg_part_size_for_too_many_parts`, `min_delay_to_insert_ms` and `max_delay_to_insert` settings). [#62420](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62420) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Changed the default installation directory on macOS from `/usr/bin` to `/usr/local/bin`. This is necessary because Apple's System Integrity Protection introduced with macOS El Capitan (2015) prevents writing into `/usr/bin`, even with `sudo`. [#62489](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62489) ([haohang](https://github.com/yokofly)).
* Make transform always return the first match. [#62518](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62518) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Added the missing `hostname` column to system table `blob_storage_log`. [#62456](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62456) ([Jayme Bird](https://github.com/jaymebrd)).
* For consistency with other system tables, `system.backup_log` now has a column `event_time`. [#62541](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62541) ([Jayme Bird](https://github.com/jaymebrd)).
* Table `system.backup_log` now has the "default" sorting key which is `event_date, event_time`, the same as for other `_log` table engines. [#62667](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62667) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Avoid evaluating table DEFAULT expressions while executing `RESTORE`. [#62601](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62601) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* S3 storage and backups also need the same default keep alive settings as s3 disk. [#62648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62648) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Add librdkafka's (that infamous C library, which has a lot of bugs) client identifier to log messages to be able to differentiate log messages from different consumers of a single table. [#62813](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62813) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Allow special macros `{uuid}` and `{database}` in a Replicated database ZooKeeper path. [#62818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62818) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Allow quota key with different auth scheme in HTTP requests. [#62842](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62842) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Reduce the verbosity of command line argument `--help` in `clickhouse client` and `clickhouse local`. The previous output is now generated by `--help --verbose`. [#62973](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62973) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* `log_bin_use_v1_row_events` was removed in MySQL 8.3, and we adjust the experimental `MaterializedMySQL` engine for it [#60479](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60479). [#63101](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63101) ([Eugene Klimov](https://github.com/Slach)). Author: Nikolay Yankin.

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Vendor in Rust dependencies, so the Rust code (that we use for minor features for hype and lulz) can be built in a sane way, similarly to C++. [#62297](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62297) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* ClickHouse now uses OpenSSL 3.2 instead of BoringSSL. [#59870](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59870) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)). Note that OpenSSL has generally worse engineering culture (such as non-zero number of sanitizer reports, that we had to patch, a complex build system with generated files, etc.) but has better compatibility.
* Ignore DROP queries in stress test with 1/2 probability, use TRUNCATE instead of ignoring DROP in upgrade check for Memory/JOIN tables. [#61476](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61476) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Remove from the Keeper Docker image the volumes at /etc/clickhouse-keeper and /var/log/clickhouse-keeper. [#61683](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61683) ([Tristan](https://github.com/Tristan971)).
* Add tests for all issues which are no longer relevant with Analyzer being enabled by default. Closes: [#55794](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/55794) Closes: [#49472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49472) Closes: [#44414](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44414) Closes: [#13843](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13843) Closes: [#55803](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/55803) Closes: [#48308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48308) Closes: [#45535](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45535) Closes: [#44365](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44365) Closes: [#44153](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44153) Closes: [#42399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42399) Closes: [#27115](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/27115) Closes: [#23162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23162) Closes: [#15395](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15395) Closes: [#15411](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15411) Closes: [#14978](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14978) Closes: [#17319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/17319) Closes: [#11813](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11813) Closes: [#13210](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13210) Closes: [#23053](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23053) Closes: [#37729](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37729) Closes: [#32639](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32639) Closes: [#9954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9954) Closes: [#41964](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41964) Closes: [#54317](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/54317) Closes: [#7520](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7520) Closes: [#36973](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36973) Closes: [#40955](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40955) Closes: [#19687](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/19687) Closes: [#23104](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23104) Closes: [#21584](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21584) Closes: [#23344](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23344) Closes: [#22627](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22627) Closes: [#10276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10276) Closes: [#19687](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/19687) Closes: [#4567](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4567) Closes: [#17710](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/17710) Closes: [#11068](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11068) Closes: [#24395](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/24395) Closes: [#23416](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23416) Closes: [#23162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23162) Closes: [#25655](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/25655) Closes: [#11757](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11757) Closes: [#6571](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6571) Closes: [#4432](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4432) Closes: [#8259](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8259) Closes: [#9233](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9233) Closes: [#14699](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14699) Closes: [#27068](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/27068) Closes: [#28687](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28687) Closes: [#28777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28777) Closes: [#29734](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/29734) Closes: [#61238](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61238) Closes: [#33825](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33825) Closes: [#35608](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35608) Closes: [#29838](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/29838) Closes: [#35652](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35652) Closes: [#36189](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36189) Closes: [#39634](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39634) Closes: [#47432](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47432) Closes: [#54910](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/54910) Closes: [#57321](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/57321) Closes: [#59154](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59154) Closes: [#61014](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61014) Closes: [#61950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61950) Closes: [#55647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/55647) Closes: [#61947](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61947).

### <a id="243"></a> ClickHouse release 24.3 LTS, 2024-03-27

#### Upgrade Notes
* The setting `allow_experimental_analyzer` is enabled by default and it switches the query analysis to a new implementation, which has better compatibility and feature completeness. The feature "analyzer" is considered beta instead of experimental. You can turn the old behavior by setting the `compatibility` to `24.2` or disabling the `allow_experimental_analyzer` setting. Watch the [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhrOYQpgvkk).
* ClickHouse allows arbitrary binary data in the String data type, which is typically UTF-8. Parquet/ORC/Arrow Strings only support UTF-8. That's why you can choose which Arrow's data type to use for the ClickHouse String data type - String or Binary. This is controlled by the settings, `output_format_parquet_string_as_string`, `output_format_orc_string_as_string`, `output_format_arrow_string_as_string`. While Binary would be more correct and compatible, using String by default will correspond to user expectations in most cases. Parquet/ORC/Arrow supports many compression methods, including lz4 and zstd. ClickHouse supports each and every compression method. Some inferior tools lack support for the faster `lz4` compression method, that's why we set `zstd` by default. This is controlled by the settings `output_format_parquet_compression_method`, `output_format_orc_compression_method`, and `output_format_arrow_compression_method`. We changed the default to `zstd` for Parquet and ORC, but not Arrow (it is emphasized for low-level usages). [#61817](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61817) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* In the new ClickHouse version, the functions `geoDistance`, `greatCircleDistance`, and `greatCircleAngle` will use 64-bit double precision floating point data type for internal calculations and return type if all the arguments are Float64. This closes [#58476](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58476). In previous versions, the function always used Float32. You can switch to the old behavior by setting `geo_distance_returns_float64_on_float64_arguments` to `false` or setting `compatibility` to `24.2` or earlier. [#61848](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61848) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)). Co-authored with [Geet Patel](https://github.com/geetptl).
* The obsolete in-memory data parts have been deprecated since version 23.5 and have not been supported since version 23.10. Now the remaining code is removed. Continuation of [#55186](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/55186) and [#45409](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45409). It is unlikely that you have used in-memory data parts because they were available only before version 23.5 and only when you enabled them manually by specifying the corresponding SETTINGS for a MergeTree table. To check if you have in-memory data parts, run the following query: `SELECT part_type, count() FROM system.parts GROUP BY part_type ORDER BY part_type`. To disable the usage of in-memory data parts, do `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY SETTING min_bytes_for_compact_part = DEFAULT, min_rows_for_compact_part = DEFAULT`. Before upgrading from old ClickHouse releases, first check that you don't have in-memory data parts. If there are in-memory data parts, disable them first, then wait while there are no in-memory data parts and continue the upgrade. [#61127](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61127) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Changed the column name from `duration_ms` to `duration_microseconds` in the `system.zookeeper` table to reflect the reality that the duration is in the microsecond resolution. [#60774](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60774) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Reject incoming INSERT queries in case when query-level settings `async_insert` and `deduplicate_blocks_in_dependent_materialized_views` are enabled together. This behaviour is controlled by a setting `throw_if_deduplication_in_dependent_materialized_views_enabled_with_async_insert` and enabled by default. This is a continuation of https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59699 needed to unblock https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59915. [#60888](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60888) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Utility `clickhouse-copier` is moved to a separate repository on GitHub: https://github.com/ClickHouse/copier. It is no longer included in the bundle but is still available as a separate download. This closes: [#60734](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60734) This closes: [#60540](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60540) This closes: [#60250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60250) This closes: [#52917](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/52917) This closes: [#51140](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/51140) This closes: [#47517](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47517) This closes: [#47189](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47189) This closes: [#46598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46598) This closes: [#40257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40257) This closes: [#36504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36504) This closes: [#35485](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35485) This closes: [#33702](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33702) This closes: [#26702](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/26702).
* To increase compatibility with MySQL, the compatibility alias `locate` now accepts arguments `(needle, haystack[, start_pos])` by default. The previous behavior `(haystack, needle, [, start_pos])` can be restored by setting `function_locate_has_mysql_compatible_argument_order = 0`. [#61092](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61092) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Forbid `SimpleAggregateFunction` in `ORDER BY` of `MergeTree` tables (like `AggregateFunction` is forbidden, but they are forbidden because they are not comparable) by default (use `allow_suspicious_primary_key` to allow them). [#61399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61399) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* The `Ordinary` database engine is deprecated. You will receive a warning in clickhouse-client if your server is using it. This closes [#52229](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/52229). [#56942](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/56942) ([shabroo](https://github.com/shabroo)).

#### New Feature
* Support reading and writing backups as `tar` (in addition to `zip`). [#59535](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59535) ([josh-hildred](https://github.com/josh-hildred)).
* Implemented support for S3 Express buckets. [#59965](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59965) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Allow to attach parts from a different disk (using copy instead of hard link). [#60112](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60112) ([Unalian](https://github.com/Unalian)).
* Size-capped `Memory` tables: controlled by their settings, `min_bytes_to_keep, max_bytes_to_keep, min_rows_to_keep` and `max_rows_to_keep`. [#60612](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60612) ([Jake Bamrah](https://github.com/JakeBamrah)).
* Separate limits on number of waiting and executing queries. Added new server setting `max_waiting_queries` that limits the number of queries waiting due to `async_load_databases`. Existing limits on number of executing queries no longer count waiting queries. [#61053](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61053) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Added a table `system.keywords` which contains all the keywords from parser. Mostly needed and will be used for better fuzzing and syntax highlighting. [#51808](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51808) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Add support for `ATTACH PARTITION ALL`. [#61107](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61107) ([Kirill Nikiforov](https://github.com/allmazz)).
* Add a new function, `getClientHTTPHeader`. This closes [#54665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/54665). Co-authored with @lingtaolf. [#61820](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61820) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add `generate_series` as a table function (compatibility alias for PostgreSQL to the existing `numbers` function). This function generates table with an arithmetic progression with natural numbers. [#59390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59390) ([divanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* A mode for `topK`/`topkWeighed` support mode, which return count of values and its error. [#54508](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/54508) ([UnamedRus](https://github.com/UnamedRus)).
* Added function `toMillisecond` which returns the millisecond component for values of type`DateTime` or `DateTime64`. [#60281](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60281) ([Shaun Struwig](https://github.com/Blargian)).
* Allow configuring HTTP redirect handlers for clickhouse-server. For example, you can make `/` redirect to the Play UI. [#60390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60390) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Optimized function `dotProduct` to omit unnecessary and expensive memory copies. [#60928](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60928) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* 30x faster printing for 256-bit integers. [#61100](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61100) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* If the table's primary key contains mostly useless columns, don't keep them in memory. This is controlled by a new setting `primary_key_ratio_of_unique_prefix_values_to_skip_suffix_columns` with the value `0.9` by default, which means: for a composite primary key, if a column changes its value for at least 0.9 of all the times, the next columns after it will be not loaded. [#60255](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60255) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improve the performance of serialized aggregation methods when involving multiple `Nullable` columns. [#55809](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/55809) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Lazy builds JSON's output to improve performance of ALL JOIN. [#58278](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58278) ([LiuNeng](https://github.com/liuneng1994)).
* Make HTTP/HTTPs connections with external services, such as AWS S3 reusable for all use cases. Even when the response is 3xx or 4xx. [#58845](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58845) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Improvements to aggregate functions `argMin` / `argMax` / `any` / `anyLast` / `anyHeavy`, as well as `ORDER BY {u8/u16/u32/u64/i8/i16/u32/i64) LIMIT 1` queries. [#58640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58640) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Trivial optimization for column's filter. Peak memory can be reduced to 44% of the original in some cases. [#59698](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59698) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Execute `multiIf` function in a columnar fashion when the result type's underlying type is a number. [#60384](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60384) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Faster (almost 2x) mutexes. [#60823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60823) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Drain multiple connections in parallel when a distributed query is finishing. [#60845](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60845) ([lizhuoyu5](https://github.com/lzydmxy)).
* Optimize data movement between columns of a Nullable number or a Nullable string, which improves some micro-benchmarks. [#60846](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60846) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Operations with the filesystem cache will suffer less from the lock contention. [#61066](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61066) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Optimize array join and other JOINs by preventing a wrong compiler's optimization. Close [#61074](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61074).  [#61075](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61075) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* If a query with a syntax error contained the `COLUMNS` matcher with a regular expression, the regular expression was compiled each time during the parser's backtracking, instead of being compiled once. This was a fundamental error. The compiled regexp was put to AST. But the letter A in AST means "abstract" which means it should not contain heavyweight objects. Parts of AST can be created and discarded during parsing, including a large number of backtracking. This leads to slowness on the parsing side and consequently allows DoS by a readonly user. But the main problem is that it prevents progress in fuzzers. [#61543](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61543) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a new analyzer pass to optimize the IN operator for a single value. [#61564](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61564) ([LiuNeng](https://github.com/liuneng1994)).
* DNSResolver shuffles set of resolved IPs which is needed to uniformly utilize multiple endpoints of AWS S3. [#60965](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60965) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Support parallel reading for Azure blob storage. This improves the performance of the experimental Azure object storage. [#61503](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61503) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add asynchronous WriteBuffer for Azure blob storage similar to S3. This improves the performance of the experimental Azure object storage. [#59929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59929) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Use managed identity for backups IO when using Azure Blob Storage. Add a setting to prevent ClickHouse from attempting to create a non-existent container, which requires permissions at the storage account level. [#61785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61785) ([Daniel Pozo Escalona](https://github.com/danipozo)).
* Add a setting `parallel_replicas_allow_in_with_subquery = 1` which allows subqueries for IN work with parallel replicas. [#60950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60950) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* A change for the "zero-copy" replication: all zero copy locks related to a table have to be dropped when the table is dropped. The directory which contains these locks has to be removed also. [#57575](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57575) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).

#### Improvement
* Use `MergeTree` as a default table engine. [#60524](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60524) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Enable `output_format_pretty_row_numbers` by default. It is better for usability. [#61791](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61791) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* In the previous version, some numbers in Pretty formats were not pretty enough. [#61794](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61794) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* A long value in Pretty formats won't be cut if it is the single value in the resultset, such as in the result of the `SHOW CREATE TABLE` query. [#61795](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61795) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Similarly to `clickhouse-local`, `clickhouse-client` will accept the `--output-format` option as a synonym to the `--format` option. This closes [#59848](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59848). [#61797](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61797) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* If stdout is a terminal and the output format is not specified, `clickhouse-client` and similar tools will use `PrettyCompact` by default, similarly to the interactive mode. `clickhouse-client` and `clickhouse-local` will handle command line arguments for input and output formats in a unified fashion. This closes [#61272](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61272). [#61800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61800) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Underscore digit groups in Pretty formats for better readability. This is controlled by a new setting, `output_format_pretty_highlight_digit_groups`. [#61802](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61802) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add ability to override initial INSERT settings via `SYSTEM FLUSH DISTRIBUTED`. [#61832](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61832) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Enable processors profiling (time spent/in and out bytes for sorting, aggregation, ...) by default. [#61096](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61096) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Support files without format extension in Filesystem database. [#60795](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60795) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Make all format names case insensitive, like Tsv, or TSV, or tsv, or even rowbinary. [#60420](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60420) ([豪肥肥](https://github.com/HowePa)). I appreciate if you will continue to write it correctly, e.g., `JSON` 😇, not `Json` 🤮, but we don't mind if you spell it as you prefer.
* Added `none_only_active` mode for `distributed_ddl_output_mode` setting. [#60340](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60340) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* The advanced dashboard has slightly better colors for multi-line graphs. [#60391](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60391) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The Advanced dashboard now has controls always visible on scrolling. This allows you to add a new chart without scrolling up. [#60692](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60692) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* While running the `MODIFY COLUMN` query for materialized views, check the inner table's structure to ensure every column exists. [#47427](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47427) ([sunny](https://github.com/sunny19930321)).
* String types and Enums can be used in the same context, such as: arrays, UNION queries, conditional expressions. This closes [#60726](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60726). [#60727](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60727) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow declaring Enums in the structure of external data for query processing (this is an immediate temporary table that you can provide for your query). [#57857](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57857) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Consider lightweight deleted rows when selecting parts to merge, so the disk size of the resulting part will be estimated better. [#58223](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58223) ([Zhuo Qiu](https://github.com/jewelzqiu)).
* Added comments for columns for more system tables. Continuation of https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58356. [#59016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59016) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Now we can use virtual columns in PREWHERE. It's worthwhile for non-const virtual columns like `_part_offset`. [#59033](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59033) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)). Improved overall usability of virtual columns. Now it is allowed to use virtual columns in `PREWHERE` (it's worthwhile for non-const virtual columns like `_part_offset`). Now a builtin documentation is available for virtual columns as a comment of column in `DESCRIBE` query with enabled setting `describe_include_virtual_columns`. [#60205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60205) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Instead of using a constant key, now object storage generates key for determining remove objects capability. [#59495](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59495) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Allow "local" as object storage type instead of "local_blob_storage". [#60165](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60165) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Parallel flush of pending INSERT blocks of Distributed engine on `DETACH`/server shutdown and `SYSTEM FLUSH DISTRIBUTED` (Parallelism will work only if you have multi-disk policy for a table (like everything in the Distributed engine right now)). [#60225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60225) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add a setting to force read-through cache for merges. [#60308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60308) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* An improvement for the MySQL compatibility protocol. The issue [#57598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/57598) mentions a variant behaviour regarding transaction handling. An issued COMMIT/ROLLBACK when no transaction is active is reported as an error contrary to MySQL behaviour. [#60338](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60338) ([PapaToemmsn](https://github.com/PapaToemmsn)).
* Function `substring` now has a new alias `byteSlice`. [#60494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60494) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Renamed server setting `dns_cache_max_size` to `dns_cache_max_entries` to reduce ambiguity. [#60500](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60500) ([Kirill Nikiforov](https://github.com/allmazz)).
* `SHOW INDEX | INDEXES | INDICES | KEYS` no longer sorts by the primary key columns (which was unintuitive). [#60514](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60514) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Keeper improvement: abort during startup if an invalid snapshot is detected to avoid data loss. [#60537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60537) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Update tzdata to 2024a. [#60768](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60768) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Keeper improvement: support `leadership_expiry_ms` in Keeper's settings. [#60806](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60806) ([Brokenice0415](https://github.com/Brokenice0415)).
* Always infer exponential numbers in JSON formats regardless of the setting `input_format_try_infer_exponent_floats`. Add setting `input_format_json_use_string_type_for_ambiguous_paths_in_named_tuples_inference_from_objects` that allows to use String type for ambiguous paths instead of an exception during named Tuples inference from JSON objects. [#60808](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60808) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add support for `START TRANSACTION` syntax typically used in MySQL syntax, resolving https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/discussions/60865. [#60886](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60886) ([Zach Naimon](https://github.com/ArctypeZach)).
* Add a flag for the full-sorting merge join algorithm to treat null as biggest/smallest. So the behavior can be compitable with other SQL systems, like Apache Spark. [#60896](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60896) ([loudongfeng](https://github.com/loudongfeng)).
* Support detect output format by file exctension in `clickhouse-client` and `clickhouse-local`. [#61036](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61036) ([豪肥肥](https://github.com/HowePa)).
* Update memory limit in runtime when Linux's CGroups value changed. [#61049](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61049) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Add the function `toUInt128OrZero`, which was missed by mistake (the mistake is related to https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/945). The compatibility aliases `FROM_UNIXTIME` and `DATE_FORMAT` (they are not ClickHouse-native and only exist for MySQL compatibility) have been made case insensitive, as expected for SQL-compatibility aliases. [#61114](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61114) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improvements for the access checks, allowing to revoke of unpossessed rights in case the target user doesn't have the revoking grants either. Example: `GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO user1; REVOKE SELECT ON system.* FROM user1;`. [#61115](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61115) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Fix `has()` function with `Nullable` column (fixes [#60214](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60214)). [#61249](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61249) ([Mikhail Koviazin](https://github.com/mkmkme)).
* Now it's possible to specify the attribute `merge="true"` in config substitutions for subtrees `<include from_zk="/path" merge="true">`. In case this attribute specified, clickhouse will merge subtree with existing configuration, otherwise default behavior is append new content to configuration. [#61299](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61299) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Add async metrics for virtual memory mappings: `VMMaxMapCount` & `VMNumMaps`. Closes [#60662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60662). [#61354](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61354) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpavn)).
* Use `temporary_files_codec` setting in all places where we create temporary data, for example external memory sorting and external memory GROUP BY. Before it worked only in `partial_merge` JOIN algorithm. [#61456](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61456) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Add a new setting `max_parser_backtracks` which allows to limit the complexity of query parsing. [#61502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61502) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Less contention during dynamic resize of the filesystem cache. [#61524](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61524) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Disallow sharded mode of StorageS3 queue, because it will be rewritten. [#61537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61537) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fixed typo: from `use_leagcy_max_level` to `use_legacy_max_level`. [#61545](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61545) ([William Schoeffel](https://github.com/wiledusc)).
* Remove some duplicate entries in `system.blob_storage_log`. [#61622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61622) ([YenchangChan](https://github.com/YenchangChan)).
* Added `current_user` function as a compatibility alias for MySQL. [#61770](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61770) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Fix inconsistent floating point aggregate function states in mixed x86-64 / ARM clusters [#60610](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60610) ([Harry Lee](https://github.com/HarryLeeIBM)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* The real-time query profiler now works on AArch64. In previous versions, it worked only when a program didn't spend time inside a syscall. [#60807](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60807) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* ClickHouse version has been added to docker labels. Closes [#54224](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/54224). [#60949](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60949) ([Nikolay Monkov](https://github.com/nikmonkov)).
* Upgrade `prqlc` to 0.11.3. [#60616](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60616) ([Maximilian Roos](https://github.com/max-sixty)).
* Add generic query text fuzzer in `clickhouse-local`. [#61508](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61508) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### <a id="242"></a> ClickHouse release 24.2, 2024-02-29

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Validate suspicious/experimental types in nested types. Previously we didn't validate such types (except JSON) in nested types like Array/Tuple/Map. [#59385](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59385) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add sanity check for number of threads and block sizes. [#60138](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60138) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Don't infer floats in exponential notation by default. Add a setting `input_format_try_infer_exponent_floats` that will restore previous behaviour (disabled by default). Closes [#59476](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59476). [#59500](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59500) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow alter operations to be surrounded by parenthesis. The emission of parentheses can be controlled by the `format_alter_operations_with_parentheses` config. By default, in formatted queries the parentheses are emitted as we store the formatted alter operations in some places as metadata (e.g.: mutations). The new syntax clarifies some of the queries where alter operations end in a list. E.g.: `ALTER TABLE x MODIFY TTL date GROUP BY a, b, DROP COLUMN c` cannot be parsed properly with the old syntax. In the new syntax the query `ALTER TABLE x (MODIFY TTL date GROUP BY a, b), (DROP COLUMN c)` is obvious. Older versions are not able to read the new syntax, therefore using the new syntax might cause issues if newer and older version of ClickHouse are mixed in a single cluster. [#59532](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59532) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Fix for the materialized view security issue, which allowed a user to insert into a table without required grants for that. Fix validates that the user has permission to insert not only into a materialized view but also into all underlying tables. This means that some queries, which worked before, now can fail with `Not enough privileges`. To address this problem, the release introduces a new feature of SQL security for views https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/view#sql_security. [#54901](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/54901) [#60439](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60439) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).

#### New Feature
* Added new syntax which allows to specify definer user in View/Materialized View. This allows to execute selects/inserts from views without explicit grants for underlying tables. So, a View will encapsulate the grants. [#54901](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/54901) [#60439](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60439) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Try to detect file format automatically during schema inference if it's unknown in `file/s3/hdfs/url/azureBlobStorage` engines. Closes [#50576](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50576). [#59092](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59092) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Implement auto-adjustment for asynchronous insert timeouts. The following settings are introduced: async_insert_poll_timeout_ms, async_insert_use_adaptive_busy_timeout, async_insert_busy_timeout_min_ms, async_insert_busy_timeout_max_ms, async_insert_busy_timeout_increase_rate, async_insert_busy_timeout_decrease_rate. [#58486](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58486) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Allow to set up a quota for maximum sequential login failures. [#54737](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/54737) ([Alexey Gerasimchuck](https://github.com/Demilivor)).
* A new aggregate function `groupArrayIntersect`. Follows up: [#49862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49862). [#59598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59598) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Backup & Restore support for `AzureBlobStorage`. Resolves [#50747](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50747). [#56988](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/56988) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* The user can now specify the template string directly in the query using `format_schema_rows_template` as an alternative to `format_template_row`. Closes [#31363](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31363). [#59088](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59088) ([Shaun Struwig](https://github.com/Blargian)).
* Implemented automatic conversion of merge tree tables of different kinds to replicated engine. Create empty `convert_to_replicated` file in table's data directory (`/clickhouse/store/xxx/xxxyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy/`) and that table will be converted automatically on next server start. [#57798](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57798) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* Added query `ALTER TABLE table FORGET PARTITION partition` that removes ZooKeeper nodes, related to an empty partition. [#59507](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59507) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)). This is an expert-level feature.
* Support JWT credentials file for the NATS table engine. [#59543](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59543) ([Nickolaj Jepsen](https://github.com/nickolaj-jepsen)).
* Implemented `system.dns_cache` table, which can be useful for debugging DNS issues. [#59856](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59856) ([Kirill Nikiforov](https://github.com/allmazz)).
* The codec `LZ4HC` will accept a new level 2, which is faster than the previous minimum level 3, at the expense of less compression. In previous versions, `LZ4HC(2)` and less was the same as `LZ4HC(3)`. Author: [Cyan4973](https://github.com/Cyan4973). [#60090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60090) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Implemented `system.dns_cache` table, which can be useful for debugging DNS issues. New server setting dns_cache_max_size. [#60257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60257) ([Kirill Nikiforov](https://github.com/allmazz)).
* Support single-argument version for the `merge` table function, as `merge(['db_name', ] 'tables_regexp')`. [#60372](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60372) ([豪肥肥](https://github.com/HowePa)).
* Support negative positional arguments. Closes [#57736](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/57736). [#58292](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58292) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Support specifying a set of permitted users for specific S3 settings in config using `user` key. [#60144](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60144) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Added table function `mergeTreeIndex`. It represents the contents of index and marks files of `MergeTree` tables. It can be used for introspection. Syntax: `mergeTreeIndex(database, table, [with_marks = true])` where `database.table` is an existing table with `MergeTree` engine. [#58140](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58140) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Added function `seriesOutliersDetectTukey` to detect outliers in series data using Tukey's fences algorithm. [#58632](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58632) ([Bhavna Jindal](https://github.com/bhavnajindal)). Keep in mind that the behavior will be changed in the next patch release.
* Add function `variantType` that returns Enum with variant type name for each row. [#59398](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59398) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support `LEFT JOIN`, `ALL INNER JOIN`, and simple subqueries for parallel replicas (only with analyzer). New setting `parallel_replicas_prefer_local_join` chooses local `JOIN` execution (by default) vs `GLOBAL JOIN`. All tables should exist on every replica from `cluster_for_parallel_replicas`. New settings `min_external_table_block_size_rows` and `min_external_table_block_size_bytes` are used to squash small blocks that are sent for temporary tables (only with analyzer). [#58916](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58916) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Allow concurrent table creation in the `Replicated` database during adding or recovering a new replica. [#59277](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59277) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Implement comparison operator for `Variant` values and proper Field inserting into `Variant` column. Don't allow creating `Variant` type with similar variant types by default (allow uder a setting `allow_suspicious_variant_types`) Closes [#59996](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59996). Closes [#59850](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59850). [#60198](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60198) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Disable parallel replicas JOIN with CTE (not analyzer) [#59239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59239) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Primary key will use less amount of memory. [#60049](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60049) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improve memory usage for primary key and some other operations. [#60050](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60050) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The tables' primary keys will be loaded in memory lazily on first access. This is controlled by the new MergeTree setting `primary_key_lazy_load`, which is on by default. This provides several advantages: - it will not be loaded for tables that are not used; - if there is not enough memory, an exception will be thrown on first use instead of at server startup. This provides several disadvantages: - the latency of loading the primary key will be paid on the first query rather than before accepting connections; this theoretically may introduce a thundering-herd problem. This closes [#11188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11188). [#60093](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60093) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Vectorized distance functions used in vector search. [#58866](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58866) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Vectorized function `dotProduct` which is useful for vector search. [#60202](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60202) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Add short-circuit ability for `dictGetOrDefault` function. Closes [#52098](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/52098). [#57767](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57767) ([jsc0218](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Keeper improvement: cache only a certain amount of logs in-memory controlled by `latest_logs_cache_size_threshold` and `commit_logs_cache_size_threshold`. [#59460](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59460) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Keeper improvement: reduce size of data node even more. [#59592](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59592) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Continue optimizing branch miss of `if` function when result type is `Float*/Decimal*/*Int*`, follow up of https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57885. [#59148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59148) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Optimize `if` function when the input type is `Map`, the speed-up is up to ~10x. [#59413](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59413) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improve performance of the `Int8` type by implementing strict aliasing (we already have it for `UInt8` and all other integer types). [#59485](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59485) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Optimize performance of sum/avg conditionally for bigint and big decimal types by reducing branch miss. [#59504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59504) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improve performance of SELECTs with active mutations. [#59531](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59531) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Optimized function `isNotNull` with AVX2. [#59621](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59621) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improve ASOF JOIN performance for sorted or almost sorted data. [#59731](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59731) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* The previous default value equals to 1 MB for `async_insert_max_data_size` appeared to be too small. The new one would be 10 MiB. [#59536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59536) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Use multiple threads while reading the metadata of tables from a backup while executing the RESTORE command. [#60040](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60040) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Now if `StorageBuffer` has more than 1 shard (`num_layers` > 1) background flush will happen simultaneously for all shards in multiple threads. [#60111](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60111) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

#### Improvement
* When output format is `Pretty` format and a block consists of a single numeric value which exceeds one million, A readable number will be printed on table right. [#60379](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60379) ([rogeryk](https://github.com/rogeryk)).
* Added settings `split_parts_ranges_into_intersecting_and_non_intersecting_final` and `split_intersecting_parts_ranges_into_layers_final`. These settings are needed to disable optimizations for queries with `FINAL` and needed for debug only. [#59705](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59705) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)). Actually not only for that - they can also lower memory usage at the expense of performance.
* Rename the setting `extract_kvp_max_pairs_per_row` to `extract_key_value_pairs_max_pairs_per_row`. The issue (unnecessary abbreviation in the setting name) was introduced in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43606. Fix the documentation of this setting. [#59683](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59683) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)). [#59960](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59960) ([jsc0218](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Running `ALTER COLUMN MATERIALIZE` on a column with `DEFAULT` or `MATERIALIZED` expression now precisely follows the semantics. [#58023](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58023) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Enabled an exponential backoff logic for errors during mutations. It will reduce the CPU usage, memory usage and log file sizes. [#58036](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58036) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* Add improvement to count the `InitialQuery` Profile Event. [#58195](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58195) ([Unalian](https://github.com/Unalian)).
* Allow to define `volume_priority` in `storage_configuration`. [#58533](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58533) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Add support for the `Date32` type in the `T64` codec. [#58738](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58738) ([Hongbin Ma](https://github.com/binmahone)).
* Allow trailing commas in types with several items. [#59119](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59119) ([Aleksandr Musorin](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).
* Settings for the Distributed table engine can now be specified in the server configuration file (similar to MergeTree settings), e.g. `<distributed> <flush_on_detach>false</flush_on_detach> </distributed>`. [#59291](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59291) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Retry disconnects and expired sessions when reading `system.zookeeper`. This is helpful when reading many rows from `system.zookeeper` table especially in the presence of fault-injected disconnects. [#59388](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59388) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Do not interpret numbers with leading zeroes as octals when `input_format_values_interpret_expressions=0`. [#59403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59403) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* At startup and whenever config files are changed, ClickHouse updates the hard memory limits of its total memory tracker. These limits are computed based on various server settings and cgroups limits (on Linux). Previously, setting `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max` (for cgroups v2) was hard-coded. As a result, cgroup v2 memory limits configured for nested groups (hierarchies), e.g. `/sys/fs/cgroup/my/nested/group/memory.max` were ignored. This is now fixed. The behavior of v1 memory limits remains unchanged. [#59435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59435) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* New profile events added to observe the time spent on calculating PK/projections/secondary indices during `INSERT`-s. [#59436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59436) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Allow to define a starting point for S3Queue with Ordered mode at the creation using a setting `s3queue_last_processed_path`. [#59446](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59446) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Made comments for system tables also available in `system.tables` in `clickhouse-local`. [#59493](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59493) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* `system.zookeeper` table: previously the whole result was accumulated in memory and returned as one big chunk. This change should help to reduce memory consumption when reading many rows from `system.zookeeper`, allow showing intermediate progress (how many rows have been read so far) and avoid hitting connection timeout when result set is big. [#59545](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59545) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Now dashboard understands both compressed and uncompressed state of URL's #hash (backward compatibility). Continuation of [#59124](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59124) . [#59548](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59548) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Bumped Intel QPL (used by codec `DEFLATE_QPL`) from v1.3.1 to v1.4.0 . Also fixed a bug for polling timeout mechanism, as we observed in same cases timeout won't work properly, if timeout happen, IAA and CPU may process buffer concurrently. So far, we'd better make sure IAA codec status is not QPL_STS_BEING_PROCESSED, then fallback to SW codec. [#59551](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59551) ([jasperzhu](https://github.com/jinjunzh)).
* Do not show a warning about the server version in ClickHouse Cloud because ClickHouse Cloud handles seamless upgrades automatically. [#59657](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59657) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* After self-extraction temporary binary is moved instead copying. [#59661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59661) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Fix stack unwinding on Apple macOS. This closes [#53653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/53653). [#59690](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59690) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Check for stack overflow in parsers even if the user misconfigured the `max_parser_depth` setting to a very high value. This closes [#59622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59622). [#59697](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59697) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)). [#60434](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60434)
* Unify XML and SQL created named collection behaviour in Kafka storage. [#59710](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59710) ([Pervakov Grigorii](https://github.com/GrigoryPervakov)).
* In case when `merge_max_block_size_bytes` is small enough and tables contain wide rows (strings or tuples) background merges may stuck in an endless loop. This behaviour is fixed. Follow-up for https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59340. [#59812](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59812) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Allow uuid in replica_path if CREATE TABLE explicitly has it. [#59908](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59908) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add column `metadata_version` of ReplicatedMergeTree table in `system.tables` system table. [#59942](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59942) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Keeper improvement: send only Keeper related metrics/events for Prometheus. [#59945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59945) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* The dashboard will display metrics across different ClickHouse versions even if the structure of system tables has changed after the upgrade. [#59967](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59967) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### <a id="241"></a> ClickHouse release 24.1, 2024-01-30

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* The setting `print_pretty_type_names` is turned on by default. You can turn it off to keep the old behavior or `SET compatibility = '23.12'`. [#57726](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57726) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The MergeTree setting `clean_deleted_rows` is deprecated, it has no effect anymore. The `CLEANUP` keyword for `OPTIMIZE` is not allowed by default (unless `allow_experimental_replacing_merge_with_cleanup` is enabled). [#58316](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58316) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* The function `reverseDNSQuery` is no longer available. This closes [#58368](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58368). [#58369](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58369) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Enable various changes to improve the access control in the configuration file. These changes affect the behavior, and you check the `config.xml` in the `access_control_improvements` section. In case you are not confident, keep the values in the configuration file as they were in the previous version. [#58584](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58584) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improve the operation of `sumMapFiltered` with NaN values. NaN values are now placed at the end (instead of randomly) and considered different from any values. `-0` is now also treated as equal to `0`; since 0 values are discarded, `-0` values are discarded too. [#58959](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58959) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* The function `visibleWidth` will behave according to the docs. In previous versions, it simply counted code points after string serialization, like the `lengthUTF8` function, but didn't consider zero-width and combining characters, full-width characters, tabs, and deletes. Now the behavior is changed accordingly. If you want to keep the old behavior, set `function_visible_width_behavior` to `0`, or set `compatibility` to `23.12` or lower. [#59022](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59022) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `Kusto` dialect is disabled until these two bugs will be fixed: [#59037](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59037) and [#59036](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59036). [#59305](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59305) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)). Any attempt to use `Kusto` will result in exception.
* More efficient implementation of the `FINAL` modifier no longer guarantees preserving the order even if `max_threads = 1`. If you counted on the previous behavior, set `enable_vertical_final` to 0 or `compatibility` to `23.12`.

#### New Feature
* Implement Variant data type that represents a union of other data types. Type `Variant(T1, T2, ..., TN)` means that each row of this type has a value of either type `T1` or `T2` or ... or `TN` or none of them (`NULL` value). Variant type is available under a setting `allow_experimental_variant_type`. Reference: [#54864](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/54864). [#58047](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58047) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Certain settings (currently `min_compress_block_size` and `max_compress_block_size`) can now be specified at column-level where they take precedence over the corresponding table-level setting. Example: `CREATE TABLE tab (col String SETTINGS (min_compress_block_size = 81920, max_compress_block_size = 163840)) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY tuple();`. [#55201](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/55201) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Add `quantileDD` aggregate function as well as the corresponding `quantilesDD` and `medianDD`. It is based on the DDSketch https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p2195-masson.pdf. ### Documentation entry for user-facing changes. [#56342](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/56342) ([Srikanth Chekuri](https://github.com/srikanthccv)).
* Allow to configure any kind of object storage with any kind of metadata type. [#58357](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58357) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Added `null_status_on_timeout_only_active` and `throw_only_active` modes for `distributed_ddl_output_mode` that allow to avoid waiting for inactive replicas. [#58350](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58350) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Add function `arrayShingles` to compute subarrays, e.g. `arrayShingles([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)` returns `[[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,5]]`. [#58396](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58396) ([Zheng Miao](https://github.com/zenmiao7)).
* Added functions `punycodeEncode`, `punycodeDecode`, `idnaEncode` and `idnaDecode` which are useful for translating international domain names to an ASCII representation according to the IDNA standard. [#58454](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58454) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Added string similarity functions `dramerauLevenshteinDistance`, `jaroSimilarity` and `jaroWinklerSimilarity`. [#58531](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58531) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Add two settings `output_format_compression_level` to change output compression level and `output_format_compression_zstd_window_log` to explicitly set compression window size and enable long-range mode for zstd compression if output compression method is `zstd`. Applied for `INTO OUTFILE` and when writing to table functions `file`, `url`, `hdfs`, `s3`, and `azureBlobStorage`. [#58539](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58539) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Automatically disable ANSI escape sequences in Pretty formats if the output is not a terminal. Add new `auto` mode to setting `output_format_pretty_color`. [#58614](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58614) ([Shaun Struwig](https://github.com/Blargian)).
* Added function `sqidDecode` which decodes [Sqids](https://sqids.org/). [#58544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58544) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Allow to read Bool values into String in JSON input formats. It's done under a setting `input_format_json_read_bools_as_strings` that is enabled by default. [#58561](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58561) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Added function `seriesDecomposeSTL` which decomposes a time series into a season, a trend and a residual component. [#57078](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57078) ([Bhavna Jindal](https://github.com/bhavnajindal)).
* Introduced MySQL Binlog Client for MaterializedMySQL: One binlog connection for many databases. [#57323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57323) ([Val Doroshchuk](https://github.com/valbok)).
* Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) provides hardware-accelerated compression and cryptograpy. ClickHouse got a new compression codec `ZSTD_QAT` which utilizes QAT for zstd compression. The codec uses [Intel's QATlib](https://github.com/intel/qatlib) and [Inte's QAT ZSTD Plugin](https://github.com/intel/QAT-ZSTD-Plugin). Right now, only compression can be accelerated in hardware (a software fallback kicks in in case QAT could not be initialized), decompression always runs in software. [#57509](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57509) ([jasperzhu](https://github.com/jinjunzh)).
* Implementing the new way how object storage keys are generated for s3 disks. Now the format could be defined in terms of `re2` regex syntax with `key_template` option in disc description. [#57663](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57663) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Table system.dropped_tables_parts contains parts of system.dropped_tables tables (dropped but not yet removed tables). [#58038](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58038) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Add settings `max_materialized_views_size_for_table` to limit the number of materialized views attached to a table. [#58068](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58068) ([zhongyuankai](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* `clickhouse-format` improvements: support INSERT queries with `VALUES`; support comments (use `--comments` to output them); support `--max_line_length` option to format only long queries in multiline. [#58246](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58246) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Attach all system tables in `clickhouse-local`, including `system.parts`. This closes [#58312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58312). [#58359](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58359) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support for `Enum` data types in function `transform`. This closes [#58241](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58241). [#58360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58360) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add table `system.database_engines`. [#58390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58390) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)). Allow registering database engines independently in the codebase. [#58365](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58365) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)). Allow registering interpreters independently. [#58443](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58443) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Added `FROM <Replicas>` modifier for `SYSTEM SYNC REPLICA LIGHTWEIGHT` query. With the `FROM` modifier ensures we wait for fetches and drop-ranges only for the specified source replicas, as well as any replica not in zookeeper or with an empty source_replica. [#58393](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58393) ([Jayme Bird](https://github.com/jaymebrd)).
* Added setting `update_insert_deduplication_token_in_dependent_materialized_views`. This setting allows to update insert deduplication token with table identifier during insert in dependent materialized views. Closes [#59165](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59165). [#59238](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59238) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Added statement `SYSTEM RELOAD ASYNCHRONOUS METRICS` which updates the asynchronous metrics. Mostly useful for testing and development. [#53710](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/53710) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Coordination for parallel replicas is rewritten for better parallelism and cache locality. It has been tested for linear scalability on hundreds of replicas. It also got support for reading in order. [#57968](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57968) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Replace HTTP outgoing buffering based with the native ClickHouse buffers. Add bytes counting metrics for interfaces. [#56064](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/56064) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Large aggregation states of `uniqExact` will be merged in parallel in distrubuted queries. [#59009](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59009) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Lower memory usage after reading from `MergeTree` tables. [#59290](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59290) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Lower memory usage in vertical merges. [#59340](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59340) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Avoid huge memory consumption during Keeper startup for more cases. [#58455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58455) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Keeper improvement: reduce Keeper's memory usage for stored nodes. [#59002](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59002) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* More cache-friendly final implementation. Note on the behaviour change: previously queries with `FINAL` modifier that read with a single stream (e.g. `max_threads = 1`) produced sorted output without explicitly provided `ORDER BY` clause. This is no longer guaranteed when `enable_vertical_final = true` (and it is so by default). [#54366](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/54366) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Bypass extra copying in `ReadBufferFromIStream` which is used, e.g., for reading from S3. [#56961](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/56961) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Optimize array element function when input is Array(Map)/Array(Array(Num)/Array(Array(String))/Array(BigInt)/Array(Decimal). The previous implementations did more allocations than needed. The optimization speed up is up to ~6x especially when input type is Array(Map). [#56403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/56403) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Read column once while reading more than one subcolumn from it in compact parts. [#57631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57631) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Rewrite the AST of `sum(column + constant)` function. This is available as an optimization pass for Analyzer [#57853](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57853) ([Jiebin Sun](https://github.com/jiebinn)).
* The evaluation of function `match` now utilizes skipping indices `ngrambf_v1` and `tokenbf_v1`. [#57882](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57882) ([凌涛](https://github.com/lingtaolf)).
* The evaluation of function `match` now utilizes inverted indices. [#58284](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58284) ([凌涛](https://github.com/lingtaolf)).
* MergeTree `FINAL` does not compare rows from same non-L0 part. [#58142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58142) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Speed up iota calls (filling array with consecutive numbers). [#58271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58271) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Speedup MIN/MAX for non-numeric types. [#58334](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58334) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Optimize the combination of filters (like in multi-stage PREWHERE) with BMI2/SSE intrinsics [#58800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58800) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Use one thread less in `clickhouse-local`. [#58968](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58968) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improve the `multiIf` function performance when the type is Nullable. [#57745](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57745) ([KevinyhZou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Add `SYSTEM JEMALLOC PURGE` for purging unused jemalloc pages, `SYSTEM JEMALLOC [ ENABLE | DISABLE | FLUSH ] PROFILE` for controlling jemalloc profile if the profiler is enabled. Add jemalloc-related 4LW command in Keeper: `jmst` for dumping jemalloc stats, `jmfp`, `jmep`, `jmdp` for controlling jemalloc profile if the profiler is enabled. [#58665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58665) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Lower memory consumption in backups to S3. [#58962](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58962) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).

#### Improvement
* Added comments (brief descriptions) to all columns of system tables. There are several reasons for this: - We use system tables a lot, and sometimes it could be very difficult for developer to understand the purpose and the meaning of a particular column. - We change (add new ones or modify existing) system tables a lot and the documentation for them is always outdated. For example take a look at the documentation page for [`system.parts`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/system-tables/parts). It misses a lot of columns - We would like to eventually generate documentation directly from ClickHouse. [#58356](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58356) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Allow queries without aliases for subqueries for `PASTE JOIN`. [#58654](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58654) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Enable `MySQL`/`MariaDB` integration on macOS. This closes [#21191](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21191). [#46316](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46316) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Disable `max_rows_in_set_to_optimize_join` by default. [#56396](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/56396) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Add `<host_name>` config parameter that allows avoiding resolving hostnames in ON CLUSTER DDL queries and Replicated database engines. This mitigates the possibility of the queue being stuck in case of a change in cluster definition. Closes [#57573](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/57573). [#57603](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57603) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Increase `load_metadata_threads` to 16 for the filesystem cache. It will make the server start up faster. [#57732](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57732) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add ability to throttle merges/mutations (`max_mutations_bandwidth_for_server`/`max_merges_bandwidth_for_server`). [#57877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57877) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Replaced undocumented (boolean) column `is_hot_reloadable` in system table `system.server_settings` by (Enum8) column `changeable_without_restart` with possible values `No`, `Yes`, `IncreaseOnly` and `DecreaseOnly`. Also documented the column. [#58029](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58029) ([skyoct](https://github.com/skyoct)).
* Cluster discovery supports setting username and password, close [#58063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58063). [#58123](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58123) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Support query parameters in `ALTER TABLE ... PART`. [#58297](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58297) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Create consumers for Kafka tables on the fly (but keep them for some period - `kafka_consumers_pool_ttl_ms`, since last used), this should fix problem with statistics for `system.kafka_consumers` (that does not consumed when nobody reads from Kafka table, which leads to live memory leak and slow table detach) and also this PR enables stats for `system.kafka_consumers` by default again. [#58310](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58310) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* `sparkBar` as an alias to `sparkbar`. [#58335](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58335) ([凌涛](https://github.com/lingtaolf)).
* Avoid sending `ComposeObject` requests after upload to `GCS`. [#58343](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58343) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Correctly handle keys with dot in the name in configurations XMLs. [#58354](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58354) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Make function `format` return constant on constant arguments. This closes [#58355](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58355). [#58358](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58358) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Adding a setting `max_estimated_execution_time` to separate `max_execution_time` and `max_estimated_execution_time`. [#58402](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58402) ([Zhang Yifan](https://github.com/zhangyifan27)).
* Provide a hint when an invalid database engine name is used. [#58444](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58444) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add settings for better control of indexes type in Arrow dictionary. Use signed integer type for indexes by default as Arrow recommends. Closes [#57401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/57401). [#58519](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58519) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Implement [#58575](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58575) Support `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD_FILE ` environment variable when running the docker image. [#58583](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58583) ([Eyal Halpern Shalev](https://github.com/Eyal-Shalev)).
* When executing some queries, which require a lot of streams for reading data, the error `"Paste JOIN requires sorted tables only"` was previously thrown. Now the numbers of streams resize to 1 in that case. [#58608](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58608) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Better message for INVALID_IDENTIFIER error. [#58703](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58703) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Improved handling of signed numeric literals in normalizeQuery. [#58710](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58710) ([Salvatore Mesoraca](https://github.com/aiven-sal)).
* Support Point data type for MySQL. [#58721](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58721) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* When comparing a Float32 column and a const string, read the string as Float32 (instead of Float64). [#58724](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58724) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improve S3 compatibility, add ECloud EOS storage support. [#58786](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58786) ([xleoken](https://github.com/xleoken)).
* Allow `KILL QUERY` to cancel backups / restores. This PR also makes running backups and restores visible in `system.processes`. Also, there is a new setting in the server configuration now - `shutdown_wait_backups_and_restores` (default=true) which makes the server either wait on shutdown for all running backups and restores to finish or just cancel them. [#58804](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58804) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Avro format to support ZSTD codec. Closes [#58735](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58735). [#58805](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58805) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* MySQL interface gained support for `net_write_timeout` and `net_read_timeout` settings. `net_write_timeout` is translated into the native `send_timeout` ClickHouse setting and, similarly, `net_read_timeout` into `receive_timeout`. Fixed an issue where it was possible to set MySQL `sql_select_limit` setting only if the entire statement was in upper case. [#58835](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58835) ([Serge Klochkov](https://github.com/slvrtrn)).
* A better exception message while conflict of creating dictionary and table with the same name. [#58841](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58841) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Make sure that for custom (created from SQL) disks ether `filesystem_caches_path` (a common directory prefix for all filesystem caches) or `custom_cached_disks_base_directory` (a common directory prefix for only filesystem caches created from custom disks) is specified in server config. `custom_cached_disks_base_directory` has higher priority for custom disks over `filesystem_caches_path`, which is used if the former one is absent. Filesystem cache setting `path` must lie inside that directory, otherwise exception will be thrown preventing disk to be created. This will not affect disks created on an older version and server was upgraded - then the exception will not be thrown to allow the server to successfully start). `custom_cached_disks_base_directory` is added to default server config as `/var/lib/clickhouse/caches/`. Closes [#57825](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/57825). [#58869](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58869) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* MySQL interface gained compatibility with `SHOW WARNINGS`/`SHOW COUNT(*) WARNINGS` queries, though the returned result is always an empty set. [#58929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58929) ([Serge Klochkov](https://github.com/slvrtrn)).
* Skip unavailable replicas when executing parallel distributed `INSERT SELECT`. [#58931](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58931) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Display word-descriptive log level while enabling structured log formatting in json. [#58936](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58936) ([Tim Liou](https://github.com/wheatdog)).
* MySQL interface gained support for `CAST(x AS SIGNED)` and `CAST(x AS UNSIGNED)` statements via data type aliases: `SIGNED` for Int64, and `UNSIGNED` for UInt64. This improves compatibility with BI tools such as Looker Studio. [#58954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58954) ([Serge Klochkov](https://github.com/slvrtrn)).
* Change working directory to the data path in docker container. [#58975](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58975) ([cangyin](https://github.com/cangyin)).
* Added setting for Azure Blob Storage `azure_max_unexpected_write_error_retries` , can also be set from config under azure section. [#59001](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59001) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Allow server to start with broken data lake table. Closes [#58625](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58625). [#59080](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59080) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Allow to ignore schema evolution in the `Iceberg` table engine and read all data using schema specified by the user on table creation or latest schema parsed from metadata on table creation. This is done under a setting `iceberg_engine_ignore_schema_evolution` that is disabled by default. Note that enabling this setting can lead to incorrect result as in case of evolved schema all data files will be read using the same schema. [#59133](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59133) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Prohibit mutable operations (`INSERT`/`ALTER`/`OPTIMIZE`/...) on read-only/write-once storages with a proper `TABLE_IS_READ_ONLY` error (to avoid leftovers). Avoid leaving left-overs on write-once disks (`format_version.txt`) on `CREATE`/`ATTACH`. Ignore `DROP` for `ReplicatedMergeTree` (so as for `MergeTree`). Fix iterating over `s3_plain` (`MetadataStorageFromPlainObjectStorage::iterateDirectory`). Note read-only is `web` disk, and write-once is `s3_plain`. [#59170](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59170) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix bug in the experimental `_block_number` column which could lead to logical error during complex combination of `ALTER`s and `merge`s. Fixes [#56202](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/56202). Replaces [#58601](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58601). [#59295](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59295) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Play UI understands when an exception is returned inside JSON. Adjustment for [#52853](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/52853). [#59303](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59303) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `/binary` HTTP handler allows to specify user, host, and optionally, password in the query string. [#59311](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59311) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support backups for compressed in-memory tables. This closes [#57893](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/57893). [#59315](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59315) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support the `FORMAT` clause in `BACKUP` and `RESTORE` queries. [#59338](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59338) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Function `concatWithSeparator` now supports arbitrary argument types (instead of only `String` and `FixedString` arguments). For example, `SELECT concatWithSeparator('.', 'number', 1)` now returns `number.1`. [#59341](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59341) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Improve aliases for clickhouse binary (now `ch`/`clickhouse` is `clickhouse-local` or `clickhouse` depends on the arguments) and add bash completion for new aliases. [#58344](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58344) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add settings changes check to CI to check that all settings changes are reflected in settings changes history. [#58555](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58555) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Use tables directly attached from S3 in stateful tests. [#58791](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58791) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Save the whole `fuzzer.log` as an archive instead of the last 100k lines. `tail -n 100000` often removes lines with table definitions. Example:. [#58821](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58821) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Enable Rust on macOS with Aarch64 (this will add fuzzy search in client with skim and the PRQL language, though I don't think that are people who host ClickHouse on darwin, so it is mostly for fuzzy search in client I would say). [#59272](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59272) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix aggregation issue in mixed x86_64 and ARM clusters [#59132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59132) ([Harry Lee](https://github.com/HarryLeeIBM)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
