# 2025 Changelog

### <a id="253"></a> ClickHouse release 25.3 LTS, 2025-03-20

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Disallow truncating replicated databases. [#76651](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76651) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Skipping index cache is reverted. [#77447](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77447) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

#### New Feature
* `JSON` data type is production-ready. See https://jsonbench.com/. `Dynamic` and `Variant` data types are production-ready. [#77785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77785) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Introduce the SSH protocol for clickhouse-server. Now, it is possible to connect to ClickHouse using any SSH client. This closes: [#74340](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74340). [#74989](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74989) ([George Gamezardashvili](https://github.com/Infjoker)).
* Replace table functions with their -Cluster alternatives if parallel replicas are enabled. Fixes [#65024](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65024). [#70659](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70659) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* A new implementation of the Userspace Page Cache, which allows caching data in the in-process memory instead of relying on the OS page cache, which is useful when the data is stored on a remote virtual filesystem without backing with the local filesystem cache. [#70509](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70509) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Added `concurrent_threads_scheduler` server setting that governs how CPU slots are distributed among concurrent queries. Could be set to `round_robin` (previous behavior) or `fair_round_robin` to address the issue of unfair CPU distribution between INSERTs and SELECTs. [#75949](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75949) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Add `estimateCompressionRatio` aggregate function [#70801](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70801). [#76661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76661) ([Tariq Almawash](https://github.com/talmawash)).
* Added function `arraySymmetricDifference`. It returns all elements from multiple array arguments which do not occur in all arguments. Example: `SELECT arraySymmetricDifference([1, 2], [2, 3])` returns `[1, 3]`. (issue [#61673](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61673)). [#76231](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76231) ([Filipp Abapolov](https://github.com/pheepa)).
* Allow to explicitly specify metadata file to read for Iceberg with storage/table function setting `iceberg_metadata_file_path `. Fixes [#47412](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47412). [#77318](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77318) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Added the `keccak256` hash function, commonly used in blockchain implementations, especially in EVM-based systems. [#76669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76669) ([Arnaud Briche](https://github.com/arnaudbriche)).
* Add three new functions. `icebergTruncate` according to specification. https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#truncate-transform-details, `toYearNumSinceEpoch` and `toMonthNumSinceEpoch`. Support `truncate` transform in partition pruning for `Iceberg` engine. [#77403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77403) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Support `LowCardinality(Decimal)` data types [#72256](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72256). [#72833](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72833) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* `FilterTransformPassedRows` and `FilterTransformPassedBytes` profile events will show the number of rows and number of bytes filtered during the query execution. [#76662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76662) ([Onkar Deshpande](https://github.com/onkar)).
* Support for the histogram metric type. The interface closely mirrors the Prometheus client, where you simply call `observe(value)` to increment the counter in the bucket corresponding to the value. The histogram metrics are exposed via `system.histogram_metrics`. [#75736](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75736) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Non-constant CASE support for switching on explicit values. [#77399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77399) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Add support [for Unity Catalog](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog) for DeltaLake tables on top of AWS S3 and local filesystem. [#76988](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76988) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Introduce experimental integration with AWS Glue service catalog for Iceberg tables. [#77257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77257) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Added support for dynamic cluster autodiscovery. This extends the existing _node_ autodiscovery feature. ClickHouse can now automatically detect and register new _clusters_ under a common ZooKeeper path using `<multicluster_root_path>`. [#76001](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76001) ([Anton Ivashkin](https://github.com/ianton-ru)).
* Allow automatic cleanup merges of entire partitions after a configurable timeout with a new setting `enable_replacing_merge_with_cleanup_for_min_age_to_force_merge`. [#76440](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76440) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Implement query condition cache to improve query performance using repeated conditions. The range of the portion of data that does not meet the condition is remembered as a temporary index in memory. Subsequent queries will use this index. Close [#67768](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/67768) [#69236](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69236) ([zhongyuankai](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* Actively evict data from the cache on parts removal. Do not let the cache grow to the maximum size if the amount of data is less. [#76641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76641) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Replace Int256 and UInt256 with clang builtin i256 in arithmetic calculation, and it gives a performance improvement [#70502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70502). [#73658](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73658) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* In some cases (e.g. empty array column) data parts can contain empty files. We can skip writing empty blobs to ObjectStorage and only store metadata for such files when the table resides on disk with separated metadata and object storages. [#75860](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75860) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Improve min/max performance for Decimal32/Decimal64/DateTime64. [#76570](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76570) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Query compilation (setting `compile_expressions`) now considers the machine type. This speeds up such queries significantly. [#76753](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76753) ([ZhangLiStar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Optimize `arraySort`. [#76850](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76850) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Disable `filesystem_cache_prefer_bigger_buffer_size` when the cache is used passively, such as for merges. [#77898](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77898) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Apply `preserve_most` attribute at some places in code, which allows slightly better code generation. [#67778](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67778) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Faster ClickHouse servers shutdown (get rid of 2.5sec delay). [#76550](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76550) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Avoid excess allocation in ReadBufferFromS3 and other remote reading buffers, reduce their memory consumption in half. [#76692](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76692) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Update zstd from 1.5.5 to 1.5.7 which could lead to some [performance improvements](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.5.7). [#77137](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77137) ([Pradeep Chhetri](https://github.com/chhetripradeep)).
* Reduce memory usage during prefetches of JSON column in Wide parts. This is relevant when ClickHouse is used on top of a shared storage, such as in ClickHouse Cloud. [#77640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77640) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Improvement
* Support atomic rename when `TRUNCATE` is used with `INTO OUTFILE`. Resolves [#70323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70323). [#77181](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77181) ([Onkar Deshpande](https://github.com/onkar)).
* It's no longer possible to use `NaN` or `inf` for float values as settings. Not like it did make any sense before. [#77546](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77546) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Disable parallel replicas by default when analyzer is disabled regardless `compatibility` setting. It's still possible to change this behavior by explicitly setting `parallel_replicas_only_with_analyzer` to `false`. [#77115](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77115) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Add the ability to define a list of headers that are forwarded from the headers of the client request to the external HTTP authenticator. [#77054](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77054) ([inv2004](https://github.com/inv2004)).
* Respect column insensitive column matching for fields in tuple columns. Close https://github.com/apache/incubator-gluten/issues/8324. [#73780](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73780) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Parameters for the codec Gorilla will now always be saved in the table metadata in .sql file. This closes: [#70072](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70072). [#74814](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74814) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Implemented parsing enhancements for certain data lakes (Sequence ID parsing: Added functionality to parse sequence identifiers in manifest files AND Avro metadata parsing: Redesigned the Avro metadata parser to be easily extendable for future enhancements). [#75010](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75010) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Remove trace_id from default ORDER BY for `system.opentelemetry_span_log`. [#75907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75907) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Encryption (the attribute `encrypted_by`) can now be applied to any configuration file (config.xml, users.xml, nested configuration files). Previously, it worked only for the top-level config.xml file. [#75911](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75911) ([Mikhail Gorshkov](https://github.com/mgorshkov)).
* Improve the `system.warnings` table and add some dynamic warning messages that can be added, updated or removed. [#76029](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76029) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* This PR makes it impossible to run a query `ALTER USER user1 ADD PROFILES a, DROP ALL PROFILES` because all `DROP` operations should come first in the order. [#76242](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76242) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Various enhancements for SYNC REPLICA (better error messages, better tests, sanity checks). [#76307](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76307) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Use correct fallback when multipart copy to S3 fails during backup with Access Denied. Multi part copy can generate Access Denied error when backup is done between buckets that have different credentials. [#76515](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76515) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Upgraded librdkafka (which is a pile of crap) to version 2.8.0 (the pile does not get any better) and improved the shutdown sequence for Kafka tables, reducing delays during table drops and server restarts. The `engine=Kafka` no longer explicitly leaves the consumer group when a table is dropped. Instead, the consumer remains in the group until it is automatically removed after `session_timeout_ms` (default: 45 seconds) of inactivity. [#76621](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76621) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Fix validation of S3 request settings. [#76658](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76658) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* System tables like `server_settings` or `settings` have a `default` value column which is convenient. Add them to `merge_tree_settings` and `replicated_merge_tree_settings`. [#76942](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76942) ([Diego Nieto](https://github.com/lesandie)).
* Added `ProfileEvents::QueryPreempted`, which has a similar logic to `CurrentMetrics::QueryPreempted`. [#77015](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77015) ([VicoWu](https://github.com/VicoWu)).
* Previously, a Replicated database could print credentials specified in a query to logs. This behaviour is fixed. This closes: [#77123](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/77123). [#77133](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77133) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Allow ALTER TABLE DROP PARTITION for `plain_rewritable disk`. [#77138](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77138) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Backup/restore setting `allow_s3_native_copy` now supports value three possible values: - `False` - s3 native copy will not be used; - `True` (old default) - ClickHouse will try s3 native copy first, if it fails then fallback to the reading+writing approach; - `'auto'` (new default) - ClickHouse will compare the source and destination credentials first. If they are same, ClickHouse will try s3 native copy and then may fallback to the reading+writing approach. If they are different, ClickHouse will go directly to the reading+writing approach. [#77401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77401) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support aws session token and environment credentials usage in delta kernel for DeltaLake table engine. [#77661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77661) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Fix stuck while processing pending batch for async distributed INSERT (due to i.e. `No such file or directory`). [#72939](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72939) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Improved datetime conversion during index analysis by enforcing saturating behavior for implicit Date to DateTime conversions. This resolves potential index analysis inaccuracies caused by datetime range limitations. This fixes [#73307](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73307). It also fixes explicit `toDateTime` conversion when `date_time_overflow_behavior = 'ignore'` which is the default value. [#73326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73326) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Fix all sort of bugs due to race between UUID and table names (for instance it will fix the race between `RENAME` and `RESTART REPLICA`, in case of concurrent `RENAME` with `SYSTEM RESTART REPLICA` you may get end up restarting wrong replica, or/and leaving one of the tables in a `Table X is being restarted` state). [#76308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76308) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix data loss when enable async insert and insert into ... from file ... with unequal block size if the first block size < async_max_size but the second block > async_max_size, the second block will not be inserted. these data is left in `squashing`. [#76343](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76343) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Renamed field 'marks' to 'marks_bytes' in `system.data_skipping_indices`. [#76374](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76374) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Fix dynamic filesystem cache resize handling unexpected errors during eviction. [#76466](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76466) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fixed `used_flag` initialization in parallel hash. It might cause a server crash. [#76580](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76580) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Fix a logical error when calling `defaultProfiles` function inside a projection. [#76627](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76627) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Do not request interactive basic auth in the browser in Web UI. Closes [#76319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76319). [#76637](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76637) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix THERE_IS_NO_COLUMN exception when selecting boolean literal from distributed tables. [#76656](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76656) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* The subpath inside the table directory is chosen in a more profound way. [#76681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76681) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Fix an error `Not found column in block` after altering a table with a subcolumn in PK. After https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72644, requires https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74403. [#76686](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76686) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Add performance tests for null shortcircuit and fix bugs. [#76708](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76708) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Flush output write buffers before finalizing them. Fix `LOGICAL_ERROR` generated during the finalization of some output format, e.g. `JSONEachRowWithProgressRowOutputFormat`. [#76726](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76726) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Added support for MongoDB's binary UUID ([#74452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74452)) - Fixed WHERE pushdown to MongoDB when using the table function ([#72210](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72210)) - Changed the MongoDB - ClickHouse type mapping such that MongoDB's binary UUID can only be parsed to ClickHouse's UUID. This should avoid ambiguities and surprises in future. - Fixed OID mapping, preserving backward compatibility. [#76762](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76762) ([Kirill Nikiforov](https://github.com/allmazz)).
* Fix exception handling in parallel prefixes deserialization of JSON subcolumns. [#76809](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76809) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix lgamma function behavior for negative integers. [#76840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76840) ([Ilya Kataev](https://github.com/IlyaKataev)).
* Fix reverse key analysis for explicitly defined primary keys. Similar to [#76654](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76654). [#76846](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76846) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Fix pretty print of Bool values in JSON format. [#76905](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76905) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix possible crash because of bad JSON column rollback on error during async inserts. [#76908](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76908) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Previously, `multiIf` may return different types of columns during planning and main execution. This resulted in code producing undefined behavior from the C++ perspective. [#76914](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76914) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Fixed incorrect serialization of constant nullable keys in MergeTree. This fixes [#76939](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76939). [#76985](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76985) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Fix sorting of `BFloat16` values. This closes [#75487](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75487). This closes [#75669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75669). [#77000](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77000) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Bug fix JSON with Variant subcolumn by adding check to skip ephemeral subcolumns in part consistency check. [#72187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72187). [#77034](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77034) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Fix crash in template parsing in Values format in case of types mismatch. [#77071](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77071) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Don't allow creating EmbeddedRocksDB table with subcolumn in primary key. Previosly such table could be created but select queries were failing. [#77074](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77074) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix illegal comparison in distributed queries because pushing down predicates to remote doesn't respect literal types. [#77093](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77093) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Fix crash during Kafka table creation with exception. [#77121](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77121) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support JSON and subcolumns in Kafka and RabbitMQ engines. [#77122](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77122) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix exceptions stack unwinding on MacOS. [#77126](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77126) ([Eduard Karacharov](https://github.com/korowa)).
* Fix reading 'null' subcolumn in getSubcolumn function. [#77163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77163) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix bloom filter index with Array and not supported functions. [#77271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77271) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* We should only check the restriction on the amount of tables during the initial CREATE query. [#77274](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77274) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Not a bug: `SELECT toBFloat16(-0.0) == toBFloat16(0.0)` now correctly returns `true` (from previously `false`). This makes the behavior consistent with `Float32` and `Float64`. [#77290](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77290) ([Shankar Iyer](https://github.com/shankar-iyer)).
* Fix posbile incorrect reference to unintialized key_index variable, which may lead to crash in debug builds (this uninitialized reference won't cause issues in release builds because subsequent code are likely to throw errors.) ### documentation entry for user-facing changes. [#77305](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77305) ([wxybear](https://github.com/wxybear)).
* Fix name for partition with a Bool value. It was broken in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74533. [#77319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77319) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix comparison between tuples with nullable elements inside and strings. As an example, before the change comparison between a Tuple `(1, null)` and a String `'(1,null)'` would result in an error. Another example would be a comparison between a Tuple `(1, a)`, where `a` is a Nullable column, and a String `'(1, 2)'`. This change addresses these issues. [#77323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77323) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Fix crash in ObjectStorageQueueSource. Was intoduced in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76358. [#77325](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77325) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix `async_insert` with `input`. [#77340](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77340) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix: `WITH FILL` may fail with NOT_FOUND_COLUMN_IN_BLOCK when sorting column is removed by planer. Similar issue related to inconsistent DAG calculated for INTERPOLATE expression. [#77343](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77343) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Fix several LOGICAL_ERRORs around setting alias of invalid AST nodes. [#77445](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77445) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* In filesystem cache impementation fix error processing during file segment write. [#77471](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77471) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Make DatabaseIceberg use correct metadata file provided by catalog. Closes [#75187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75187). [#77486](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77486) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* The query cache now assumes that UDFs are non-deterministic. Accordingly, results of queries with UDFs are no longer cached. Previously, users were able to define non-deterministic UDFs whose result would erronously be cached (issue [#77553](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/77553)). [#77633](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77633) ([Jimmy Aguilar Mena](https://github.com/Ergus)).
* Fix system.filesystem_cache_log working only under setting `enable_filesystem_cache_log`. [#77650](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77650) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fix a logical error when calling `defaultRoles` function inside a projection. Follow-up for [#76627](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76627). [#77667](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77667) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Second arguments of type `Nullable` for function `arrayResize` are now disallowed. Previously, anything from errors to wrong results could happen with `Nullable` as second argument. (issue [#48398](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48398)). [#77724](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77724) ([Manish Gill](https://github.com/mgill25)).
* Regularly check if merges and mutations were cancelled even in case when the operation doesn't produce any blocks to write. [#77766](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77766) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* `clickhouse-odbc-bridge` and `clickhouse-library-bridge` are moved to a separate repository, https://github.com/ClickHouse/odbc-bridge/. [#76225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76225) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix Rust cross-compilation and allow disabling Rust completely. [#76921](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76921) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).


### <a id="252"></a> ClickHouse release 25.2, 2025-02-27

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Completely enable `async_load_databases` by default (even for those installations that do not upgrade `config.xml`). [#74772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74772) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add `JSONCompactEachRowWithProgress` and `JSONCompactStringsEachRowWithProgress` formats. Continuation of [#69989](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69989). The `JSONCompactWithNames` and `JSONCompactWithNamesAndTypes` no longer output "totals" - apparently, it was a mistake in the implementation. [#75037](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75037) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Change the `format_alter_operations_with_parentheses` default to true to disambiguate the ALTER commands list (see https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59532). This breaks replication with clusters prior to 24.3. If you are upgrading a cluster using older releases turn off the setting in the server config or upgrade to 24.3 first. [#75302](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75302) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Remove the possibility of filtering log messages using regular expressions. The implementation introduced a data race, so it has to be removed. [#75577](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75577) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* The setting `min_chunk_bytes_for_parallel_parsing` cannot be zero anymore. This fixes: [#71110](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71110). [#75239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75239) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Validate settings in the cache configuration. Non existing settings were ignored before, now they will throw an error and they should be removed. [#75452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75452) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

#### New Feature
* Support type `Nullable(JSON)`. [#73556](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73556) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support subcolumns in the DEFAULT and MATERIALIZED expressions. [#74403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74403) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support writing Parquet bloom filters using the `output_format_parquet_write_bloom_filter` setting (enabled by default). [#71681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71681) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Web UI now has interactive database navigation. [#75777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75777) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow the combination of read-only and read-write disks in the storage policy (as multiple volumes or multiple disks). This allows data to be read from the entire volume, while inserts will prefer the writable disk (i.e., Copy-on-Write storage policy). [#75862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75862) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add a new Database engine, `DatabaseBackup,` that allows to instantly attach table/database from backup. [#75725](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75725) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Support prepared statements in the Postgres wire protocol. [#75035](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75035) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Add the ability to ATTACH tables without a database layer, which is useful for MergeTree tables located on Web, S3, and similar external virtual filesystems. [#75788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75788) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add a new string comparison function, `compareSubstrings` to compare parts of two strings. Example: `SELECT compareSubstrings('Saxony', 'Anglo-Saxon', 0, 6, 5) AS result` means "compare 6 bytes of strings 'Saxon' and 'Anglo-Saxon' lexicographically, starting at offset 0 in the first string, offset 5 in the second string". [#74070](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74070) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* A new function, `initialQueryStartTime` is added. It returns the start time of the current query. The value is the same across all shards during a distributed query. [#75087](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75087) ([Roman Lomonosov](https://github.com/lomik)).
* Add support for SSL authentication with named collections for MySQL. Closes [#59111](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59111). [#59452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59452) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).

#### Experimental Features
* Added a new setting, `enable_adaptive_memory_spill_scheduler` that allows multiple Grace JOINs in the same query to monitor their combined memory footprint and trigger spilling into external storage adaptively to prevent MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED. [#72728](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72728) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Make the new, experimental `Kafka` table engine fully respect Keeper feature flags. [#76004](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76004) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Restore the (Intel) QPL codec, which was removed in v24.10 due to licensing issues. [#76021](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76021) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* For the integration with HDFS added support for the `dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname` configuration option. [#74635](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74635) ([Mikhail Tiukavkin](https://github.com/freshertm)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Improve performance of the whole JSON column reading in Wide parts from S3. It's done by adding prefetches for subcolumn prefixes deserialization, cache of deserialized prefixes, and parallel deserialization of subcolumn prefixes. It improves the reading of the JSON column from S3 4 times in queries like `SELECT data FROM table` and about 10 times in queries like `SELECT data FROM table LIMIT 10`. [#74827](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74827) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fixed unnecessary contention in `parallel_hash` when `max_rows_in_join = max_bytes_in_join = 0`. [#75155](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75155) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Fixed double preallocation in `ConcurrentHashJoin` in case join sides are swapped by the optimizer. [#75149](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75149) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Slight improvement in some join scenarios: precalculate the number of output rows and reserve memory for them. [#75376](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75376) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* For queries like `WHERE a < b AND b < c AND c < 5`, we can infer new comparing conditions (`a < 5 AND b < 5`) to have better filter ability. [#73164](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73164) ([Shichao Jin](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Keeper improvement: disable digest calculation when committing to in-memory storage for better performance. It can be enabled with `keeper_server.digest_enabled_on_commit` config. Digest is still calculated when preprocessing requests. [#75490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75490) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Push down filter expression from JOIN ON when possible. [#75536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75536) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Calculate columns and indices sizes lazily in MergeTree. [#75938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75938) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Reintroduce respect `ttl_only_drop_parts` on `MATERIALIZE TTL`; only read necessary columns to recalculate TTL and drop parts by replacing them with an empty ones. [#72751](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72751) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Reduce write buffer size for plain_rewritable metadata files [#75758](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75758) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Reduce memory usage for some window functions. [#65647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65647) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Evaluate parquet bloom filters and min/max indexes together. Necessary to properly support: `x = 3 or x > 5` where data = [1, 2, 4, 5]. [#71383](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71383) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Queries passed to the `Executable` storage are no longer limited to a single-threaded execution. [#70084](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70084) ([yawnt](https://github.com/yawnt)).
* Fetch parts in parallel in ALTER TABLE FETCH PARTITION (thread pool size is controlled with `max_fetch_partition_thread_pool_size`). [#74978](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74978) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Allow to move predicates with the `indexHint` function to `PREWHERE`. [#74987](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74987) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

#### Improvement
* Fixed calculation of size in memory for `LowCardinality` columns. [#74688](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74688) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* `processors_profile_log` table now has a default configuration with a TTL of 30 days. [#66139](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66139) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Allow naming shards in the cluster configuration. [#72276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72276) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* Change Prometheus remote write response success status from 200/OK to 204/NoContent. [#74170](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74170) ([Michael Dempsey](https://github.com/bluestealth)).
* Add ability to reload `max_remote_read_network_bandwidth_for_serve` and `max_remote_write_network_bandwidth_for_server` on the fly without restart server. [#74206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74206) ([Kai Zhu](https://github.com/nauu)).
* Allow using blob paths to calculate checksums while making a backup. [#74729](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74729) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Added a query ID column to `system.query_cache` (closes [#68205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68205)). [#74982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74982) ([NamHoaiNguyen](https://github.com/NamHoaiNguyen)).
* It is allowed to cancel `ALTER TABLE ... FREEZE ...` queries with `KILL QUERY` and automatically by a timeout (`max_execution_time`). [#75016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75016) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* Add support for `groupUniqArrayArrayMap` as `SimpleAggregateFunction`. [#75034](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75034) ([Miel Donkers](https://github.com/mdonkers)).
* Hide catalog credential settings in database engine `Iceberg`. Closes [#74559](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74559). [#75080](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75080) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* `intExp2` / `intExp10`: Define undefined behaviour: return 0 for too small argument, `18446744073709551615` for too big argument, throw exception if `nan`. [#75312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75312) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support `s3.endpoint` natively from catalog config in `DatabaseIceberg`. Closes [#74558](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74558). [#75375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75375) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Don't fail silently if a user executing `SYSTEM DROP REPLICA` doesn't have enough permissions. [#75377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75377) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add a ProfileEvent about the number of times any of the system logs have failed to flush. [#75466](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75466) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a check and extra logging for decrypting and decompressing. [#75471](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75471) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Added support for the micro sign (U+00B5) in the `parseTimeDelta` function. Now both the micro sign (U+00B5) and the Greek letter mu (U+03BC) are recognized as valid representations for microseconds, aligning ClickHouse's behavior with Go’s implementation ([see time.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ad7b46ee4ac1cee5095d64b01e8cf7fcda8bee5e/src/time/time.go#L983C19-L983C20) and [time/format.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ad7b46ee4ac1cee5095d64b01e8cf7fcda8bee5e/src/time/format.go#L1608-L1609)). [#75472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75472) ([Vitaly Orlov](https://github.com/orloffv)).
* Replace server setting (`send_settings_to_client`) with client setting (`apply_settings_from_server`) that controls whether client-side code (e.g., parsing INSERT data and formatting query output) should use settings from server's `users.xml` and user profile. Otherwise, only settings from the client command line, session, and query are used. Note that this only applies to native client (not e.g. HTTP), and doesn't apply to most of query processing (which happens on the server). [#75478](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75478) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Better error messages for syntax errors. Previously, if the query was too large, and the token whose length exceeds the limit is a very large string literal, the message about the reason was lost in the middle of two examples of this very long token. Fix the issue when a query with UTF-8 was cut incorrectly in the error message. Fix excessive quoting of query fragments. This closes [#75473](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75473). [#75561](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75561) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add profile events in storage `S3(Azure)Queue`. [#75618](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75618) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Disable sending settings from server to client (`send_settings_to_client=false`) for compatibility (This feature will be re-implemented as a client setting later for better usability). [#75648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75648) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Add a config `memory_worker_correct_memory_tracker` to enable correction of the internal memory tracker with information from different sources read in the background thread periodically. [#75714](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75714) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add column `normalized_query_hash` into `system.processes`. Note: while it can be easily calculated on the fly with the `normalizedQueryHash` function, this is needed to prepare for subsequent changes. [#75756](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75756) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Querying `system.tables` will not throw even if there is a `Merge` table created over a database that no longer exists. Remove the `getTotalRows` method from `Hive` tables because we don't allow it to do complex work. [#75772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75772) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Store start_time/end_time for Backups with microseconds. [#75929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75929) ([Aleksandr Musorin](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).
* Add `MemoryTrackingUncorrected` metric showing the value of the internal global memory tracker which is not corrected by RSS. [#75935](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75935) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Allow parsing endpoints like `localhost:1234/handle` in `PostgreSQL` or `MySQL` table functions. This fixes a regression introduced in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/52503. [#75944](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75944) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Added a server setting `throw_on_unknown_workload` that allows to choose behavior on query with `workload` setting set to unknown value: either allow unlimited access (default) or throw a `RESOURCE_ACCESS_DENIED` error. It is useful to force all queries to use workload scheduling. [#75999](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75999) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Don't rewrite subcolumns to `getSubcolumn` in `ARRAY JOIN` if not necessary. [#76018](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76018) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Retry coordination errors when loading tables. [#76020](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76020) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Support flushing individual logs in `SYSTEM FLUSH LOGS`. [#76132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76132) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improved the `/binary` server's page. Using the Hilbert curve instead of the Morton curve. Display 512 MB worth of addresses in the square, which fills the square better (in previous versions, addresses fill only half of the square). Color addresses closer to the library name rather than the function name. Allow scrolling a bit more outside of the area. [#76192](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76192) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Retry ON CLUSTER queries in case of TOO_MANY_SIMULTANEOUS_QUERIES. [#76352](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76352) ([Patrick Galbraith](https://github.com/CaptTofu)).
* Add the `CPUOverload` asynchronous metric, which calculates the server's relative CPU deficit. [#76404](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76404) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Changed the default value of `output_format_pretty_max_rows` from 10000 to 1000. I think it is better for usability. [#76407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76407) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Fix formatting of exceptions using a custom format if they appear during query interpretation. In previous versions, exceptions were formatted using the default format rather than the format specified in the query. This closes [#55422](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/55422). [#74994](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74994) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix type mapping for SQLite (integer types into `int64`, floating points into `float64`). [#73853](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73853) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Fix identifier resolution from parent scopes. Allow the use of aliases to expressions in the WITH clause. Fixes [#58994](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/58994). Fixes [#62946](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/62946). Fixes [#63239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/63239). Fixes [#65233](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65233). Fixes [#71659](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71659). Fixes [#71828](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71828). Fixes [#68749](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68749). [#66143](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66143) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Fix negate function monotonicity. In previous versions, the query `select * from a where -x = -42;` where `x` is the primary key, can return a wrong result. [#71440](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71440) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Fix empty tuple handling in arrayIntersect. This fixes [#72578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72578). [#72581](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72581) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Fix reading JSON sub-object subcolumns with incorrect prefix. [#73182](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73182) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Propagate Native format settings properly for client-server communication. [#73924](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73924) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Check for not supported types for some storages. [#74218](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74218) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix crash with query `INSERT INTO SELECT` over PostgreSQL interface on macOS (issue [#72938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72938)). [#74231](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74231) ([Artem Yurov](https://github.com/ArtemYurov)).
* Fixed uninitialized max_log_ptr in the replicated database. [#74336](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74336) ([Konstantin Morozov](https://github.com/k-morozov)).
* Fix crash when inserting interval (issue [#74299](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74299)). [#74478](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74478) ([NamHoaiNguyen](https://github.com/NamHoaiNguyen)).
* Fix formatting constant JSON literals. Previously it could lead to syntax errors during sending the query to another server. [#74533](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74533) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix broken create query when using constant partition expressions with implicit projections enabled. This fixes [#74596](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74596) . [#74634](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74634) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

* Keeper: fix logical_error when the connection had been terminated before establishing. [#74844](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74844) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Fix a behavior when the server couldn't startup when there's a table using `AzureBlobStorage`. Tables are loaded without any requests to Azure. [#74880](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74880) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Fix missing `used_privileges` and `missing_privileges` fields in `query_log` for BACKUP and RESTORE operations. [#74887](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74887) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* HDFS refresh krb ticket if sasl error during hdfs select request. [#74930](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74930) ([inv2004](https://github.com/inv2004)).
* Fix queries to Replicated database in startup_scripts. [#74942](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74942) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix issues with expressions type aliased in the JOIN ON clause when a null-safe comparison is used. [#74970](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74970) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Revert part's state from deleting back to outdated when remove operation has failed. [#74985](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74985) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* In previous versions, when there was a scalar subquery, we started writing the progress (accumulated from processing the subquery) during the initialization of the data format, which was before HTTP headers were written. This led to the loss of HTTP headers, such as X-ClickHouse-QueryId and X-ClickHouse-Format, as well as Content-Type. [#74991](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74991) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix `CREATE TABLE AS...` queries for `database_replicated_allow_replicated_engine_arguments=0`. [#75000](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75000) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).

* Fixed usage of indexes (primary and secondary) for `Array`, `Map` and `Nullable(..)` columns with enabled setting `optimize_function_to_subcolumns`. Previously, indexes for these columns could have been ignored. [#75081](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75081) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Disable `flatten_nested` when creating materialized views with inner tables since it will not be possible to use such flattened columns. [#75085](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75085) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Fix for some of IPv6 addresses (such as ::ffff:1.1.1.1) in forwarded_for field is wrongly interpreted resulting in client disconnect with exception. [#75133](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75133) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Fix nullsafe JOIN handling for LowCardinality nullable data type. Previously JOIN ON with nullsafe comparison, such as `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`, `<=>` , `a IS NULL AND b IS NULL OR a == b` didn't work correctly with LowCardinality columns. [#75143](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75143) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Checks that we don't specify key_condition when counting total_number_of_rows for NumRowsCache. [#75164](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75164) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).

* Keeper fix: avoid writing to broken changelogs when rolling back logs. [#75197](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75197) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Use `BFloat16` as a supertype where appropriate. This closes: [#74404](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74404). [#75236](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75236) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

* Mask azureblobstorage table engine credentials. [#75319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75319) ([Garrett Thomas](https://github.com/garrettthomaskth)).
* Fixed behavior when ClickHouse may erroneously do a filter pushdown to an external database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite. This closes: [#71423](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71423). [#75320](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75320) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Fix crash in protobuf schema cache that can happen during output in Protobuf format and parallel query `SYSTEM DROP FORMAT SCHEMA CACHE`. [#75357](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75357) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix a possible logical error or uninitialized memory issue when a filter from `HAVING` is pushed down with parallel replicas. [#75363](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75363) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).

* Function `TRIM` with computed empty trim characters are now correctly handled. Example: `SELECT TRIM(LEADING concat('') FROM 'foo')` (Issue [#69922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69922)). [#75399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75399) ([Manish Gill](https://github.com/mgill25)).

* Fix possible error `Elements ... and ... of Nested data structure ... (Array columns) have different array sizes` when JSON subcolumns with Array type are used in JOIN over distributed tables. [#75512](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75512) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix data corruption with `CODEC(ZSTD, DoubleDelta)`. Closes [#70031](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70031). [#75548](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75548) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).

* Respect `materialized_views_ignore_errors` when a materialized view writes to a URL engine and there is a connectivity issue. [#75679](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75679) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Fixed rare crashes while reading from `MergeTree` table after multiple asynchronous `RENAME` queries (with `alter_sync = 0`) between columns with different types. [#75693](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75693) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fix `Block structure mismatch in QueryPipeline stream` error for some queries with `UNION ALL`. [#75715](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75715) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Rebuild projection on alter modify of its PK column. Previously it could lead to `CANNOT_READ_ALL_DATA` errors during selects after alter modify of the column used in projection PK. [#75720](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75720) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix incorrect result of `ARRAY JOIN` for scalar subqueries (with analyzer). [#75732](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75732) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

* Fix uninitialized memory read in function `translate`. This closes [#75592](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75592). [#75794](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75794) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Propagate format settings to JSON as string formatting in Native format. [#75832](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75832) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Recorded the default enablement of parallel hash as join algorithm in v24.12 in the settings change history. This means that ClickHouse will continue to join using non-parallel hash if an older compatibility level than v24.12 is configured. [#75870](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75870) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Fixed a bug that tables with implicitly added min-max indices could not be copied into a new table (issue [#75677](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75677)). [#75877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75877) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* `clickhouse-library-bridge` allows opening arbitrary libraries from the filesystem, which makes it safe to run only inside an isolated environment. To prevent a vulnerability when it is run near the clickhouse-server, we will limit the paths of libraries to a location, provided in the configuration. This vulnerability was found with the [ClickHouse Bug Bounty Program](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38986) by **Arseniy Dugin**. [#75954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75954) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* We happened to use JSON serialization for some metadata, which was a mistake, because JSON does not support binary data inside string literals, including zero bytes. SQL queries can contain binary data and invalid UTF-8, so we have to support this in our metadata files as well. At the same time, ClickHouse's `JSONEachRow` and similar formats work around that by deviating from the JSON standard in favor of a perfect roundtrip for the binary data. See the motivation here: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73668#issuecomment-2560501790. The solution is to make `Poco::JSON` library consistent with the JSON format serialization in ClickHouse. This closes [#73668](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73668). [#75963](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75963) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix check for commit limits in storage `S3Queue`. [#76104](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76104) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fix attaching MergeTree tables with auto indexes (`add_minmax_index_for_numeric_columns`/`add_minmax_index_for_string_columns`). [#76139](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76139) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fixed issue of stack traces from parent threads of a job (`enable_job_stack_trace` setting) are not printed out. Fixed issue `enable_job_stack_trace` setting is not properly propagated to the threads resulting stack trace content not always respects this setting. [#76191](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76191) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Fix incorrect permission check where `ALTER RENAME` required `CREATE USER` grant. Closes [#74372](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74372). [#76241](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76241) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Fix reinterpretAs with FixedString on big-endian architecture. [#76253](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76253) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix logical error in S3Queue "Expected current processor {} to be equal to {} for bucket {}". [#76358](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76358) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fix deadlock for ALTER with Memory database. [#76359](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76359) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix logical error in index analysis if condition in `WHERE` has `pointInPolygon` function. [#76360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76360) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fix potentially unsafe call in signal handler. [#76549](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76549) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Fix reverse key support in PartsSplitter. This fixes [#73400](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73400). [#73418](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73418) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Support build HDFS on both ARM and Intel Mac. [#74244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74244) ([Yan Xin](https://github.com/yxheartipp)).
* Enable ICU and GRPC when cross-compiling for Darwin. [#75922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75922) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Update to embedded LLVM 19. [#75148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75148) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Disable network access for user default in the docker image. [#75259](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75259) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)). Make all clickhouse-server related actions a function, and execute them only when launching the default binary in `entrypoint.sh`. A long-postponed improvement was suggested in [#50724](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50724). Added switch `--users` to `clickhouse-extract-from-config` to get values from the `users.xml`. [#75643](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75643) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Remove about 20MB of dead code from the binary. [#76226](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76226) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### <a id="251"></a> ClickHouse release 25.1, 2025-01-28

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* `JSONEachRowWithProgress` will write the progress whenever the progress happens. In previous versions, the progress was shown only after each block of the result, which made it useless. Change the way how the progress is displayed: it will not show zero values. This closes [#70800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70800). [#73834](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73834) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `Merge` tables will unify the structure of underlying tables by using a union of their columns and deriving common types. This closes [#64864](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64864). In certain cases, this change could be backward incompatible. One example is when there is no common type between tables, but conversion to the type of the first table is still possible, such as in the case of UInt64 and Int64 or any numeric type and String. If you want to return to the old behavior, set `merge_table_max_tables_to_look_for_schema_inference` to `1` or set `compatibility` to `24.12` or earlier. [#73956](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73956) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Parquet output format converts Date and DateTime columns to date/time types supported by Parquet, instead of writing them as raw numbers. `DateTime` becomes `DateTime64(3)` (was: `UInt32`); setting `output_format_parquet_datetime_as_uint32` brings back the old behavior. `Date` becomes `Date32` (was: `UInt16`). [#70950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70950) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Don't allow not comparable types (like `JSON`/`Object`/`AggregateFunction`) in `ORDER BY` and comparison functions `less/greater/equal/etc` by default. [#73276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73276) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* The obsolete `MaterializedMySQL` database engine has been removed and is no longer available. [#73879](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73879) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `mysql` dictionary source no longer does `SHOW TABLE STATUS` query, because it does not provide any value for InnoDB tables, as long as for any recent MySQL versions. This closes [#72636](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72636). This change is backward compatible, but put in this category so you have a chance to notice it. [#73914](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73914) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `CHECK TABLE` queries now require a separate, `CHECK` grant. In previous versions, it was enough to have `SHOW TABLES` grant to run these queries. But a `CHECK TABLE` query can be heavy, and usual query complexity limits for `SELECT` queries don't apply to it. It led to the potential of DoS. [#74471](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74471) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Function `h3ToGeo()` now returns the results in the order `(lat, lon)` (which is the standard order for geometric functions). Users who wish to retain the legacy result order `(lon, lat)` can set setting `h3togeo_lon_lat_result_order = true`. [#74719](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74719) ([Manish Gill](https://github.com/mgill25)).
* A new MongoDB driver is now the default. Users who like to continue using the legacy driver can set server setting `use_legacy_mongodb_integration` to true. [#73359](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73359) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

#### New Feature
* Added an ability to apply non-finished (not materialized by background process) mutations during the execution of `SELECT` queries immediately after submitting. It can be enabled by setting `apply_mutations_on_fly`. [#74877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74877) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Implement `Iceberg` tables partition pruning for time-related transform partition operations in Iceberg. [#72044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72044) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Support subcolumns in MergeTree sorting key and skip indexes. [#72644](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72644) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support reading `HALF_FLOAT` values from `Apache Arrow`/`Parquet`/`ORC` (they are read into `Float32`). This closes [#72960](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72960). Keep in mind that IEEE-754 half float is not the same as `BFloat16`. Closes [#73835](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73835). [#73836](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73836) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `system.trace_log` table will contain two new columns, `symbols` and `lines` containing symbolized stack trace. It allows for easy collection and export of profile information. This is controlled by the server configuration value `symbolize` inside `trace_log` and is enabled by default. [#73896](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73896) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a new function, `generateSerialID`, which can be used to generate auto-incremental numbers in tables. Continuation of [#64310](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64310) by [kazalika](https://github.com/kazalika). This closes [#62485](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/62485). [#73950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73950) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add syntax `query1 PARALLEL WITH query2 PARALLEL WITH query3 ... PARALLEL WITH queryN` for DDL queries. That means subqueries `{query1, query2, ... queryN}` are allowed to run in parallel with each other (and it's preferable). [#73983](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73983) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Added an in-memory cache for deserialized skipping index granules. This should make repeated queries that use skipping indexes faster. The size of the new cache is controlled by server settings `skipping_index_cache_size` and `skipping_index_cache_max_entries`. The original motivation for the cache were vector similarity indexes which became a lot faster now. [#70102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70102) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Now, the embedded Web UI has a progress bar during query runtime. It allows cancelling queries. It displays the total number of records and the extended information about the speed. The table can be rendered incrementally as soon as data arrives. Enable HTTP compression. Rendering of the table became faster. The table header became sticky. It allows selecting cells and navigating them by arrow keys. Fix the issue when the outline of the selected cell makes it smaller. Cells no longer expand on mouse hover but only on selection. The moment to stop rendering the incoming data is decided on the client rather than on the server side. Highlight digit groups for numbers. The overall design was refreshed and became bolder. It checks if the server is reachable and the correctness of credentials and displays the server version and uptime. The cloud icon is contoured in every font, even in Safari. Big integers inside nested data types will be rendered better. It will display inf/nan correctly. It will display data types when the mouse is over a column header. [#74204](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74204) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add the ability to create min-max (skipping) indices by default for columns managed by MergeTree using settings `add_minmax_index_for_numeric_columns` (for numeric columns) and `add_minmax_index_for_string_columns` (for string columns). For now, both settings are disabled, so there is no behavior change yet. [#74266](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74266) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add `script_query_number` and `script_line_number` fields to `system.query_log`, to the ClientInfo in the native protocol, and to server logs. This closes [#67542](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/67542). Credits to [pinsvin00](https://github.com/pinsvin00) for kicking off this feature earlier in [#68133](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68133). [#74477](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74477) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added aggregation function `sequenceMatchEvents` which return timestamps of matched events for longest chain of events in pattern. [#72349](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72349) ([UnamedRus](https://github.com/UnamedRus)).
* Added function `arrayNormalizedGini`. [#72823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72823) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Add minus operator support for `DateTime64`, to allow subtraction between `DateTime64` values, as well as `DateTime`. [#74482](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74482) ([Li Yin](https://github.com/liyinsg)).

#### Experimental Features
* The `BFloat16` data type is production-ready. [#73840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73840) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Optimized function `indexHint`. Now, columns that are only used as arguments of function `indexHint` are not read from the table. [#74314](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74314) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)). If the `indexHint` function is a central piece of your enterprise data architecture, this optimization will save your life.

* Splitting of left table blocks by hash was removed from the probe phase of the `parallel_hash` JOIN algorithm. [#73089](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73089) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Optimize RowBinary input format. Closes [#63805](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/63805). [#65059](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65059) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Write parts with level 1 if `optimize_on_insert` is enabled. It allows to use several optimizations of queries with `FINAL` for freshly written parts. [#73132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73132) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Speedup string deserialization by some low-level optimisation. [#65948](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65948) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* When running an equality comparison between records, such as during merges, start to compare rows from most likely unequal columns first. [#63780](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63780) ([UnamedRus](https://github.com/UnamedRus)).

* Short circuit optimization for functions executed over Nullable arguments. [#73820](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73820) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Do not apply `maskedExecute` on non-function columns, improve the performance of short circuit execution. [#73965](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73965) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Disable the autodetection of headers in input formats for `Kafka`/`NATS`/`RabbitMQ`/`FileLog` to improve performance. [#74006](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74006) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

* Parallel replicas performance improvement. Packets deserialization on query initiator, for packets not related to parallel replicas protocol, now always happens in pipeline thread. Before, it could happen in a thread responsible for pipeline scheduling, which could make initiator less responsive and delay pipeline execution. [#74398](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74398) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Improve performance of larger multi requests in Keeper. [#74849](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74849) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).

This PR updates the replica's error count when unavailable. [#72666](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72666) ([zoomxi](https://github.com/zoomxi)).
* Added a merge tree setting `materialize_skip_indexes_on_merge` which suppresses the creation of skip indexes during merge. This allows users to control explicitly (via `ALTER TABLE [..] MATERIALIZE INDEX [...]`) when skip indexes are created. This can be useful if skip indexes are expensive to build (e.g. vector similarity indexes). [#74401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74401) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

This is controlled by the `output_format_pretty_max_column_name_width_cut_to` and `output_format_pretty_max_column_name_width_min_chars_to_cut` settings. This is the continuation of the work of [tanmaydatta](https://github.com/tanmaydatta) in [#66502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/66502). This closes [#65968](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65968). [#73851](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73851) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Make `Pretty` formats prettier: squash blocks if not much time passed since the output of the previous block. This is controlled by new settings `output_format_pretty_squash_consecutive_ms` (50 ms by default) and `output_format_pretty_squash_max_wait_ms` (1000 ms by default). Continuation of [#49537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49537). This closes [#49153](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49153). [#73852](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73852) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* The `JSONEachRowWithProgress` format will include events with metadata, as well as totals and extremes. It also includes `rows_before_limit_at_least` and `rows_before_aggregation`. The format prints the exception properly if it arrives after partial results. The progress now includes elapsed nanoseconds. One final progress event is emitted at the end. The progress during query runtime will be printed no more frequently than the value of the `interactive_delay` setting. [#74181](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74181) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Hourglass will rotate smoothly in Play UI. [#74182](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74182) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* If the number of output records is larger than N = `output_format_pretty_max_rows`, instead of displaying only the first N rows, we will cut the output table in the middle, displaying N/2 first rows and N/2 last rows. Continuation of [#64200](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64200). This closes [#59502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59502). [#73929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73929) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Historically for some reason, the query `ALTER TABLE MOVE PARTITION TO TABLE` checked `SELECT` and `ALTER DELETE` rights instead of dedicated `ALTER_MOVE_PARTITION`. This PR makes use of this access type. For compatibility, this permission is also will be granted implicitly if `SELECT` and `ALTER DELETE` are granted, but this behavior will be removed in future releases. Closes [#16403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16403). [#71632](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71632) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).

* Add the `latest_fail_error_code_name` column to `system.mutations`. We need this column to introduce a new metric on stuck mutations and use it to build graphs of the errors encountered in the cloud as well as, optionally, adding a new less-noisy alert. [#72398](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72398) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Reduce amount of allocation in the `ATTACH PARTITION` query. [#72583](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72583) ([Konstantin Morozov](https://github.com/k-morozov)).
* Make `max_bytes_before_external_sort` limit depends on total query memory consumption (previously it was number of bytes in the sorting block for one sorting thread, now it has the same meaning as `max_bytes_before_external_group_by` - it is total limit for the whole query memory for all threads). Also one more setting added to control on disk block size - `min_external_sort_block_bytes`. [#72598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72598) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
