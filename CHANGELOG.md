### ClickHouse release v22.2, 2022-02-17

#### Upgrade Notes

* Applying data skipping indexes for queries with FINAL may produce incorrect result. In this release we disabled data skipping indexes by default for queries with FINAL (a new setting `use_skip_indexes_if_final` is introduced and disabled by default). [#34243](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34243) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### New Feature

* Projections are production ready. Set `allow_experimental_projection_optimization` by default and deprecate this setting. [#34456](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34456) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* An option to create a new files on insert for `File`/`S3`/`HDFS` engines. Allow to overwrite a file in `HDFS`. Throw an exception in attempt to overwrite a file in `S3` by default. Throw an exception in attempt to append data to file in formats that have a suffix (and thus don't support appends, like `Parquet`, `ORC`). Closes [#31640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31640) Closes [#31622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31622) Closes [#23862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23862) Closes [#15022](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15022) Closes [#16674](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16674). [#33302](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33302) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add a setting that allows a user to provide own deduplication semantic in `MergeTree`/`ReplicatedMergeTree` If provided, it's used instead of data digest to generate block ID. So, for example, by providing a unique value for the setting in each INSERT statement, the user can avoid the same inserted data being deduplicated. This closes: [#7461](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7461). [#32304](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32304) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Add support of `DEFAULT` keyword for INSERT statements. Closes [#6331](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6331). [#33141](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33141) ([Andrii Buriachevskyi](https://github.com/1over)).
* `EPHEMERAL` column specifier is added to `CREATE TABLE` query. Closes [#9436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9436). [#34424](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34424) ([yakov-olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Support `IF EXISTS` clause for `TTL expr TO [DISK|VOLUME] [IF EXISTS] 'xxx'` feature. Parts will be moved to disk or volume only if it exists on replica, so `MOVE TTL` rules will be able to behave differently on replicas according to the existing storage policies. Resolves [#34455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34455). [#34504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34504) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

[#15765](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15765) ([johnskopis](https://github.com/johnskopis)). [#31257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31257) ([Filatenkov Artur](https://github.com/FArthur-cmd)).
* Now ReplicatedMergeTree can recover data when some of its disks are broken. [#13544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13544) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Fault-tolerant connections in clickhouse-client: `clickhouse-client ... --host host1 --host host2 --port port2 --host host3 --port port --host host4`. [#34490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34490) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Add memory overcommit to `MemoryTracker`. Added `guaranteed` settings for memory limits which represent soft memory limits. In case when hard memory limit is reached, `MemoryTracker` tries to cancel the most overcommited query. New setting `memory_usage_overcommit_max_wait_microseconds` specifies how long queries may wait another query to stop. Closes [#28375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28375).

#### Performance Improvement

* Support `optimize_read_in_order` if prefix of sorting key is already sorted. E.g. if we have sorting key `ORDER BY (a, b)` in table and query with `WHERE a = const ORDER BY b` clauses, now it will be applied reading in order of sorting key instead of full sort. [#32748](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32748) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improve performance of partitioned insert into table functions `URL`, `S3`, `File`, `HDFS`. Closes [#34348](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34348). [#34510](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34510) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).

### ClickHouse release v22.1, 2022-01-18

#### Upgrade Notes

* The functions `left` and `right` were previously implemented in parser and now full-featured. Distributed queries with `left` or `right` functions without aliases may throw exception if cluster contains different versions of clickhouse-server. If you are upgrading your cluster and encounter this error, you should finish upgrading your cluster to ensure all nodes have the same version. Also you can add aliases (`AS something`) to the columns in your queries to avoid this issue. [#33407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33407) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Resource usage by scalar subqueries is fully accounted since this version. With this change, rows read in scalar subqueries are now reported in the query_log. If the scalar subquery is cached (repeated or called for several rows) the rows read are only counted once. This change allows KILLing queries and reporting progress while they are executing scalar subqueries. [#32271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32271) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

#### New Feature

* Implement data schema inference for input formats. Allow to skip structure (or write just `auto`) in table functions `file`, `url`, `s3`, `hdfs` and in parameters of `clickhouse-local` . Allow to skip structure in create query for table engines `File`, `HDFS`, `S3`, `URL`, `Merge`, `Buffer`, `Distributed` and `ReplicatedMergeTree` (if we add new replicas). [#32455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32455) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Detect format by file extension in `file`/`hdfs`/`s3`/`url` table functions and `HDFS`/`S3`/`URL` table engines and also for `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` and `INSERT FROM INFILE` [#33565](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33565) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)). Close [#30918](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/30918). [#33443](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33443) ([OnePiece](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* A tool for collecting diagnostics data if you need support. [#33175](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33175) ([Alexander Burmak](https://github.com/Alex-Burmak)).
* Automatic cluster discovery via Zoo/Keeper. It allows to add replicas to the cluster without changing configuration on every server. [#31442](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31442) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Implement hive table engine to access apache hive from clickhouse. This implements: [#29245](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/29245). [#31104](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31104) ([taiyang-li](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add aggregate functions `cramersV`, `cramersVBiasCorrected`, `theilsU` and `contingency`. These functions calculate dependency (measure of association) between categorical values. All these functions are using cross-tab (histogram on pairs) for implementation. You can imagine it like a correlation coefficient but for any discrete values (not necessary numbers). [#33366](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33366) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)). Initial implementation by [Vanyok-All-is-OK](https://github.com/Vanyok-All-is-OK) and [antikvist](https://github.com/antikvist).
* Added table function `hdfsCluster` which allows processing files from HDFS in parallel from many nodes in a specified cluster, similarly to `s3Cluster`. [#32400](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32400) ([Zhichang Yu](https://github.com/yuzhichang)).
* Adding support for disks backed by Azure Blob Storage, in a similar way it has been done for disks backed by AWS S3. [#31505](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31505) ([Jakub Kuklis](https://github.com/jkuklis)).
* Allow `COMMENT` in `CREATE VIEW` (for all VIEW kinds). [#31062](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31062) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk)).
* Dynamically reinitialize listening ports and protocols when configuration changes. [#30549](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/30549) ([Kevin Michel](https://github.com/kmichel-aiven)).
* Added `left`, `right`, `leftUTF8`, `rightUTF8` functions. Fix error in implementation of `substringUTF8` function with negative offset (offset from the end of string). [#33407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33407) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add new functions for `H3` coordinate system: `h3HexAreaKm2`, `h3CellAreaM2`, `h3CellAreaRads2`. [#33479](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33479) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add `MONTHNAME` function. [#33436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33436) ([usurai](https://github.com/usurai)).
* Added function `arrayLast`. Closes [#33390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33390). [#33415](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33415) Added function `arrayLastIndex`. [#33465](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33465) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Add function `decodeURLFormComponent` slightly different to `decodeURLComponent`. Close [#10298](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10298). [#33451](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33451) ([SuperDJY](https://github.com/cmsxbc)).
* Allow to split `GraphiteMergeTree` rollup rules for plain/tagged metrics (optional rule_type field). [#33494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33494) ([Michail Safronov](https://github.com/msaf1980)).


#### Performance Improvement

* Support moving conditions to `PREWHERE` (setting `optimize_move_to_prewhere`) for tables of `Merge` engine if its all underlying tables supports `PREWHERE`. [#33300](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33300) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* More efficient handling of globs for URL storage. Now you can easily query million URLs in parallel with retries. Closes [#32866](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32866). [#32907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32907) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Avoid exponential backtracking in parser. This closes [#20158](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/20158). [#33481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33481) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Abuse of `untuple` function was leading to exponential complexity of query analysis (found by fuzzer). This closes [#33297](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33297). [#33445](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33445) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Reduce allocated memory for dictionaries with string attributes. [#33466](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33466) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Slight performance improvement of `reinterpret` function. [#32587](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32587) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Non significant change. In extremely rare cases when data part is lost on every replica, after merging of some data parts, the subsequent queries may skip less amount of partitions during partition pruning. This hardly affects anything. [#32220](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32220) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Improve `clickhouse-keeper` writing performance by optimization the size calculation logic. [#32366](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32366) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Optimize single part projection materialization. This closes [#31669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31669). [#31885](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31885) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

* Optimize selecting of MergeTree parts that can be moved between volumes. [#33225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33225) ([OnePiece](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* Fix `sparse_hashed` dict performance with sequential keys (wrong hash function). [#32536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32536) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).


#### Experimental Feature

* Parallel reading from multiple replicas within a shard during distributed query without using sample key. To enable this, set `allow_experimental_parallel_reading_from_replicas = 1` and `max_parallel_replicas` to any number. This closes [#26748](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/26748). [#29279](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/29279) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Implemented sparse serialization. It can reduce usage of disk space and improve performance of some queries for columns, which contain a lot of default (zero) values. It can be enabled by setting `ratio_for_sparse_serialization`. Sparse serialization will be chosen dynamically for column, if it has ratio of number of default values to number of all values above that threshold. Serialization (default or sparse) will be fixed for every column in part, but may varies between parts.
