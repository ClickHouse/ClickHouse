## ClickHouse release 20.5

### ClickHouse release v20.5.2.7-stable 2020-07-02

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* Return non-Nullable result from COUNT(DISTINCT), and `uniq` aggregate functions family. If all passed values are NULL, return zero instead. This improves SQL compatibility. [#11661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11661) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added a check for the case when user-level setting is specified in a wrong place. User-level settings should be specified in `users.xml` inside `<profile>` section for specific user profile (or in `<default>` for default settings). The server won't start with exception message in log. This fixes [#9051](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9051). If you want to skip the check, you can either move settings to the appropriate place or add `<skip_check_for_incorrect_settings>1</skip_check_for_incorrect_settings>` to config.xml. [#11449](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11449) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The setting `input_format_with_names_use_header` is enabled by default. It will affect parsing of input formats `-WithNames` and `-WithNamesAndTypes`. [#10937](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10937) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove `experimental_use_processors` setting. It is enabled by default. [#10924](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10924) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Update `zstd` to 1.4.4. It has some minor improvements in performance and compression ratio. If you run replicas with different versions of ClickHouse you may see reasonable error messages `Data after merge is not byte-identical to data on another replicas.` with explanation. These messages are Ok and you should not worry. This change is backward compatible but we list it here in changelog in case you will wonder about these messages. [#10663](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10663) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added a check for meaningless codecs and a setting `allow_suspicious_codecs` to control this check. This closes [#4966](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4966). [#10645](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10645) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fix crash in `quantilesExactWeightedArray`. [#11337](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11337) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Now merges stopped before change metadata in `ALTER` queries. [#11335](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11335) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Make writing to `MATERIALIZED VIEW` with setting `parallel_view_processing = 1` parallel again. Fixes [#10241](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10241). [#11330](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11330) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

* Fix the issue when index analysis cannot work if a table has Array column in primary key and if a query is filtering by this column with `empty` or `notEmpty` functions. This fixes [#11286](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11286). [#11303](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11303) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix bug when query speed estimation can be incorrect and the limit of `min_execution_speed` may not work or work incorrectly if the query is throttled by `max_network_bandwidth`, `max_execution_speed` or `priority` settings. Change the default value of `timeout_before_checking_execution_speed` to non-zero, because otherwise the settings `min_execution_speed` and `max_execution_speed` have no effect. This fixes [#11297](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11297). This fixes [#5732](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5732). This fixes [#6228](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6228). Usability improvement: avoid concatenation of exception message with progress bar in `clickhouse-client`. [#11296](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11296) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fixed a bug when `cache` dictionary could return default value instead of normal (when there are only expired keys). This affects only string fields. [#11233](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11233) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Fix error `Block structure mismatch in QueryPipeline` while reading from `VIEW` with constants in inner query. Fixes [#11181](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11181).

* If data skipping index is dependent on columns that are going to be modified during background merge (for SummingMergeTree, AggregatingMergeTree as well as for TTL GROUP BY), it was calculated incorrectly. This issue is fixed by moving index calculation after merge so the index is calculated on merged data. [#11162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11162) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

* Fix incorrect raw data size in method getRawData(). [#10964](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10964) ([Igr](https://github.com/ObjatieGroba)).
* Fix incompatibility of two-level aggregation between versions 20.1 and earlier. This incompatibility happens when different versions of ClickHouse are used on initiator node and remote nodes and the size of GROUP BY result is large and aggregation is performed by a single String field. It leads to several unmerged rows for a single key in result. [#10952](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10952) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fix possible race which could happen when you get result from aggregate function state from multiple thread for the same column. The only way (which I found) it can happen is when you use `finalizeAggregation` function while reading from table with `Memory` engine which stores `AggregateFunction` state for `quanite*` function. [#10890](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10890) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

* Fix predicates optimization for distributed queries (`enable_optimize_predicate_expression=1`) for queries with `HAVING` section (i.e. when filtering on the server initiator is required), by preserving the order of expressions (and this is enough to fix), and also force aggregator use column names over indexes. Fixes: [#10613](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10613), [#11413](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11413). [#10621](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10621) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### Improvement

* Apply `TTL` for old data, after `ALTER MODIFY TTL` query. This behaviour is controlled by setting `materialize_ttl_after_modify`, which is enabled by default. [#11042](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11042) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* When parsing C-style backslash escapes in string literals, VALUES and various text formats (this is an extension to SQL standard that is endemic for ClickHouse and MySQL), keep backslash if unknown escape sequence is found (e.g. `\%` or `\w`) that will make usage of `LIKE` and `match` regular expressions more convenient (it's enough to write `name LIKE 'used\_cars'` instead of `name LIKE 'used\\_cars'`) and more compatible at the same time. This fixes [#10922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10922). [#11208](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11208) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* When reading Decimal value, cut extra digits after point. This behaviour is more compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. This fixes [#10202](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10202). [#11831](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11831) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow to DROP replicated table if the metadata in ZooKeeper was already removed and does not exist (this is also the case when using TestKeeper for testing and the server was restarted). Allow to RENAME replicated table even if there is an error communicating with ZooKeeper. This fixes [#10720](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10720). [#11652](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11652) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Slightly improve diagnostic of reading decimal from string. This closes [#10202](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10202). [#11829](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11829) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix sleep invocation in signal handler. It was sleeping for less amount of time than expected. [#11825](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11825) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* (Only Linux) OS related performance metrics (for CPU and I/O) will work even without `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability. [#10544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10544) ([Alexander Kazakov](https://github.com/Akazz)).
* Added `hostname` as an alias to function `hostName`. This feature was suggested by Victor Tarnavskiy from Yandex.Metrica. [#11821](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11821) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added support for distributed `DDL` (update/delete/drop partition) on cross replication clusters. [#11703](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11703) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Emit warning instead of error in server log at startup if we cannot listen one of the listen addresses (e.g. IPv6 is unavailable inside Docker). Note that if server fails to listen all listed addresses, it will refuse to startup as before. This fixes [#4406](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4406). [#11687](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11687) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Default user and database creation on docker image starting. [#10637](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10637) ([Paramtamtam](https://github.com/tarampampam)).

* Added OpenCL support and bitonic sort algorithm, which can be used for sorting integer types of data in single column. Needs to be build with flag `-DENABLE_OPENCL=1`. For using bitonic sort algorithm instead of others you need to set `bitonic_sort` for Setting's option `special_sort` and make sure that OpenCL is available. This feature does not improve performance or anything else, it is only provided as an example and for demonstration purposes. It is likely to be removed in near future if there will be no further development in this direction. [#10232](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10232) ([Ri](https://github.com/margaritiko)).

#### Bug Fix

* Fix rare crash caused by using `Nullable` column in prewhere condition. Continuation of [#11608](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11608). [#11869](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11869) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Don't allow arrayJoin inside higher order functions. It was leading to broken protocol synchronization. This closes [#3933](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/3933). [#11846](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11846) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix wrong result of comparison of FixedString with constant String. This fixes [#11393](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11393). This bug appeared in version 20.4. [#11828](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11828) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fix rare crash caused by using `Nullable` column in prewhere condition. (Probably it is connected with [#11572](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11572) somehow). [#11608](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11608) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Fix error `Block structure mismatch` for queries with sampling reading from `Buffer` table. [#11602](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11602) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Fix wrong exit code of the clickhouse-client, when exception.code() % 256 = 0. [#11601](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11601) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Fix trivial error in log message about "Mark cache size was lowered" at server startup. This closes [#11399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11399). [#11589](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11589) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fixed rare segfault in `SHOW CREATE TABLE` Fixes [#11490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11490). [#11579](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11579) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* All queries in HTTP session have had the same query_id. It is fixed. [#11578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11578) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

* Fix race condition which may lead to an exception during table drop. It's a bit tricky and not dangerous at all. If you want an explanation, just notice me in telegram. [#11523](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11523) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Fix memory leak when exception is thrown in the middle of aggregation with -State functions. This fixes [#8995](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8995). [#11496](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11496) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* If data skipping index is dependent on columns that are going to be modified during background merge (for SummingMergeTree, AggregatingMergeTree as well as for TTL GROUP BY), it was calculated incorrectly. This issue is fixed by moving index calculation after merge so the index is calculated on merged data. [#11162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11162) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Get rid of old libunwind patches. https://github.com/ClickHouse-Extras/libunwind/commit/500aa227911bd185a94bfc071d68f4d3b03cb3b1#r39048012 This allows to disable `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` in `clang` builds that improves performance at least by 1% in average.

### ClickHouse release v20.4.2.9, 2020-05-12

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* System tables (e.g. system.query_log, system.trace_log, system.metric_log) are using compact data part format for parts smaller than 10 MiB in size. Compact data part format is supported since version 20.3. If you are going to downgrade to version less than 20.3, you should manually delete table data for system logs in `/var/lib/clickhouse/data/system/`.
* When string comparison involves FixedString and compared arguments are of different sizes, do comparison as if smaller string is padded to the length of the larger. This is intented for SQL compatibility if we imagine that FixedString data type corresponds to SQL CHAR. This closes [#9272](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9272). [#10363](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10363) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Make SHOW CREATE TABLE multiline. Now it is more readable and more like MySQL. [#10049](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10049) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))
* Added a setting `validate_polygons` that is used in `pointInPolygon` function and enabled by default. [#9857](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9857) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))

#### Bug Fix

* Fix rare crash caused by using `Nullable` column in prewhere condition. Continuation of [#11608](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11608). [#11869](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11869) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Don't allow arrayJoin inside higher order functions. It was leading to broken protocol synchronization. This closes [#3933](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/3933). [#11846](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11846) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix using too many threads for queries. [#11788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11788) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Fix unexpected behaviour of queries like `SELECT *, xyz.*` which were success while an error expected. [#11753](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11753) ([hexiaoting](https://github.com/hexiaoting)).
* Now replicated fetches will be cancelled during metadata alter. [#11744](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11744) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Fixed LOGICAL_ERROR caused by wrong type deduction of complex literals in Values input format. [#11732](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11732) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Fix `ORDER BY ... WITH FILL` over const columns. [#11697](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11697) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

* All queries in HTTP session have had the same query_id. It is fixed. [#11578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11578) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Now clickhouse-server docker container will prefer IPv6 checking server aliveness. [#11550](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11550) ([Ivan Starkov](https://github.com/istarkov)).
* Fix shard_num/replica_num for `<node>` (breaks use_compact_format_in_distributed_parts_names). [#11528](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11528) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

### ClickHouse release v20.3.11.97-lts 2020-06-10

#### New Feature

* Now ClickHouse controls timeouts of dictionary sources on its side. Two new settings added to cache dictionary configuration: `strict_max_lifetime_seconds`, which is `max_lifetime` by default and `query_wait_timeout_milliseconds`, which is one minute by default. The first settings is also useful with `allow_read_expired_keys` settings (to forbid reading very expired keys).

### ClickHouse release v20.3.5.21, 2020-03-27

#### Bug Fix

* Fix 'Different expressions with the same alias' error when query has PREWHERE and WHERE on distributed table and `SET distributed_product_mode = 'local'`. [#9871](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9871) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).
* Fix mutations excessive memory consumption for tables with a composite primary key. This fixes [#9850](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9850). [#9860](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9860) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* For INSERT queries shard now clamps the settings got from the initiator to the shard's constaints instead of throwing an exception. This fix allows to send INSERT queries to a shard with another constraints. This change improves fix [#9447](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9447). [#9852](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9852) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Fix 'COMMA to CROSS JOIN rewriter is not enabled or cannot rewrite query' error in case of subqueries with COMMA JOIN out of tables lists (i.e. in WHERE). Fixes [#9782](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9782). [#9830](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9830) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).
* Fix possible exception `Got 0 in totals chunk, expected 1` on client. It happened for queries with `JOIN` in case if right joined table had zero rows. Example: `select * from system.one t1 join system.one t2 on t1.dummy = t2.dummy limit 0 FORMAT TabSeparated;`. Fixes [#9777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9777). [#9823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9823) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Fix SIGSEGV with optimize_skip_unused_shards when type cannot be converted. [#9804](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9804) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix broken `ALTER TABLE DELETE COLUMN` query for compact parts. [#9779](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9779) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Fix max_distributed_connections (w/ and w/o Processors). [#9673](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9673) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fixed a few cases when timezone of the function argument wasn't used properly. [#9574](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9574) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk)).

#### Improvement

* Remove order by stage from mutations because we read from a single ordered part in a single thread. Also add check that the order of rows in mutation is ordered in sorting key order and this order is not violated. [#9886](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9886) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).


### ClickHouse release v20.3.4.10, 2020-03-20

#### Bug Fix
* This release also contains all bug fixes from 20.1.8.41
* Fix missing `rows_before_limit_at_least` for queries over http (with processors pipeline). This fixes [#9730](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9730). [#9757](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9757) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai))


### ClickHouse release v20.3.3.6, 2020-03-17

#### Bug Fix
* This release also contains all bug fixes from 20.1.7.38
* Fix bug in a replication that doesn't allow replication to work if the user has executed mutations on the previous version. This fixes [#9645](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9645). [#9652](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9652) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)). It makes version 20.3 backward compatible again.
* Add setting `use_compact_format_in_distributed_parts_names` which allows to write files for `INSERT` queries into `Distributed` table with more compact format. This fixes [#9647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9647). [#9653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9653) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)). It makes version 20.3 backward compatible again.

### ClickHouse release v20.3.2.1, 2020-03-12

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* Fixed the issue `file name too long` when sending data for `Distributed` tables for a large number of replicas. Fixed the issue that replica credentials were exposed in the server log. The format of directory name on disk was changed to `[shard{shard_index}[_replica{replica_index}]]`. [#8911](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8911) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb)) After you upgrade to the new version, you will not be able to downgrade without manual intervention, because old server version does not recognize the new directory format. If you want to downgrade, you have to manually rename the corresponding directories to the old format. This change is relevant only if you have used asynchronous `INSERT`s to `Distributed` tables. In the version 20.3.3 we will introduce a setting that will allow you to enable the new format gradually.
* Changed the format of replication log entries for mutation commands. You have to wait for old mutations to process before installing the new version.
* Implement simple memory profiler that dumps stacktraces to `system.trace_log` every N bytes over soft allocation limit [#8765](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8765) ([Ivan](https://github.com/abyss7)) [#9472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9472) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)) The column of `system.trace_log` was renamed from `timer_type` to `trace_type`. This will require changes in third-party performance analysis and flamegraph processing tools.
* Use OS thread id everywhere instead of internal thread number. This fixes [#7477](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7477) Old `clickhouse-client` cannot receive logs that are send from the server when the setting `send_logs_level` is enabled, because the names and types of the structured log messages were changed. On the other hand, different server versions can send logs with different types to each other. When you don't use the `send_logs_level` setting, you should not care. [#8954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8954) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Remove `indexHint` function [#9542](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9542) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Remove `findClusterIndex`, `findClusterValue` functions. This fixes [#8641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8641). If you were using these functions, send an email to `clickhouse-feedback@yandex-team.com` [#9543](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9543) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Now it's not allowed to create columns or add columns with `SELECT` subquery as default expression. [#9481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9481) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Require aliases for subqueries in JOIN. [#9274](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9274) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Improved `ALTER MODIFY/ADD` queries logic. Now you cannot `ADD` column without type, `MODIFY` default expression doesn't change type of column and `MODIFY` type doesn't loose default expression value. Fixes [#8669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8669). [#9227](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9227) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Require server to be restarted to apply the changes in logging configuration. This is a temporary workaround to avoid the bug where the server logs to a deleted log file (see [#8696](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8696)). [#8707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8707) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm))
* The setting `experimental_use_processors` is enabled by default. This setting enables usage of the new query pipeline. This is internal refactoring and we expect no visible changes. If you will see any issues, set it to back zero. [#8768](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8768) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))

#### New Feature
* Add `Avro` and `AvroConfluent` input/output formats [#8571](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8571) ([Andrew Onyshchuk](https://github.com/oandrew)) [#8957](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8957) ([Andrew Onyshchuk](https://github.com/oandrew)) [#8717](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8717) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Multi-threaded and non-blocking updates of expired keys in `cache` dictionaries (with optional permission to read old ones). [#8303](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8303) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov))
* Add query `ALTER ... MATERIALIZE TTL`. It runs mutation that forces to remove expired data by TTL and recalculates meta-information about TTL in all parts. [#8775](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8775) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))
* Switch from HashJoin to MergeJoin (on disk) if needed [#9082](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9082) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Added `MOVE PARTITION` command for `ALTER TABLE` [#4729](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4729) [#6168](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/6168) ([Guillaume Tassery](https://github.com/YiuRULE))

* Allowed to change `storage_policy` to not less rich one. [#8107](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8107) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon))
* Added support for globs/wildcards for S3 storage and table function. [#8851](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8851) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon))
* Implement `bitAnd`, `bitOr`, `bitXor`, `bitNot` for `FixedString(N)` datatype. [#9091](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9091) ([Guillaume Tassery](https://github.com/YiuRULE))
* Added function `bitCount`. This fixes [#8702](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8702). [#8708](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8708) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)) [#8749](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8749) ([ikopylov](https://github.com/ikopylov))
* Add `generateRandom` table function to generate random rows with given schema. Allows to populate arbitrary test table with data. [#8994](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8994) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega))
* `JSONEachRowFormat`: support special case when objects enclosed in top-level array. [#8860](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8860) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar))
* Now it's possible to create a column with `DEFAULT` expression which depends on a column with default `ALIAS` expression. [#9489](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9489) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Allow to specify `--limit` more than the source data size in `clickhouse-obfuscator`. The data will repeat itself with different random seed. [#9155](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9155) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Added `groupArraySample` function (similar to `groupArray`) with reservior sampling algorithm. [#8286](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8286) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird))
* Now you can monitor the size of update queue in `cache`/`complex_key_cache` dictionaries via system metrics. [#9413](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9413) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov))
* Allow to use CRLF as a line separator in CSV output format with setting `output_format_csv_crlf_end_of_line` is set to 1 [#8934](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8934) [#8935](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8935) [#8963](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8963) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb))
* Implement more functions of the [H3](https://github.com/uber/h3) API: `h3GetBaseCell`, `h3HexAreaM2`, `h3IndexesAreNeighbors`, `h3ToChildren`, `h3ToString` and `stringToH3` [#8938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8938) ([Nico Mandery](https://github.com/nmandery))
* New setting introduced: `max_parser_depth` to control maximum stack size and allow large complex queries. This fixes [#6681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6681) and [#7668](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7668). [#8647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8647) ([Maxim Smirnov](https://github.com/qMBQx8GH))
* Add a setting `force_optimize_skip_unused_shards` setting to throw if skipping of unused shards is not possible [#8805](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8805) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))
* Allow to configure multiple disks/volumes for storing data for send in `Distributed` engine [#8756](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8756) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))
* Support storage policy (`<tmp_policy>`) for storing temporary data. [#8750](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8750) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))
* Added `X-ClickHouse-Exception-Code` HTTP header that is set if exception was thrown before sending data. This implements [#4971](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4971). [#8786](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8786) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb))
* Added function `ifNotFinite`. It is just a syntactic sugar: `ifNotFinite(x, y) = isFinite(x) ? x : y`. [#8710](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8710) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Added `last_successful_update_time` column in `system.dictionaries` table [#9394](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9394) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov))
* Add `blockSerializedSize` function (size on disk without compression) [#8952](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8952) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))
* Add function `moduloOrZero` [#9358](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9358) ([hcz](https://github.com/hczhcz))
* Added system tables `system.zeros` and `system.zeros_mt` as well as tale functions `zeros()` and `zeros_mt()`. Tables (and table functions) contain single column with name `zero` and type `UInt8`. This column contains zeros. It is needed for test purposes as the fastest method to generate many rows. This fixes [#6604](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6604) [#9593](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9593) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai))

#### Experimental Feature
* Add new compact format of parts in `MergeTree`-family tables in which all columns are stored in one file. It helps to increase performance of small and frequent inserts. The old format (one file per column) is now called wide. Data storing format is controlled by settings `min_bytes_for_wide_part` and `min_rows_for_wide_part`. [#8290](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8290) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))
* Support for S3 storage for `Log`, `TinyLog` and `StripeLog` tables. [#8862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8862) ([Pavel Kovalenko](https://github.com/Jokser))

#### Bug Fix
* Fixed inconsistent whitespaces in log messages. [#9322](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9322) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Fix bug in which arrays of unnamed tuples were flattened as Nested structures on table creation. [#8866](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8866) ([achulkov2](https://github.com/achulkov2))
* Fixed the issue when "Too many open files" error may happen if there are too many files matching glob pattern in `File` table or `file` table function. Now files are opened lazily. This fixes [#8857](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8857) [#8861](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8861) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* DROP TEMPORARY TABLE now drops only temporary table. [#8907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8907) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar))
* Remove outdated partition when we shutdown the server or DETACH/ATTACH a table. [#8602](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8602) ([Guillaume Tassery](https://github.com/YiuRULE))
* For how the default disk calculates the free space from `data` subdirectory. Fixed the issue when the amount of free space is not calculated correctly if the `data` directory is mounted to a separate device (rare case). This fixes [#7441](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7441) [#9257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9257) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb))

* Fix possible incorrect result after `GROUP BY` with enabled setting `distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient`. Fixes [#9134](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9134). [#9289](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9289) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai))
* Found keys were counted as missed in metrics of cache dictionaries. [#9411](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9411) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov))
* Fix replication protocol incompatibility introduced in [#8598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8598). [#9412](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9412) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Fixed race condition on `queue_task_handle` at the startup of `ReplicatedMergeTree` tables. [#9552](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9552) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* The token `NOT` didn't work in `SHOW TABLES NOT LIKE` query [#8727](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8727) [#8940](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8940) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Added range check to function `h3EdgeLengthM`. Without this check, buffer overflow is possible. [#8945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8945) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Fixed up a bug in batched calculations of ternary logical OPs on multiple arguments (more than 10). [#8718](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8718) ([Alexander Kazakov](https://github.com/Akazz))

* Fix unexpected `Timeout exceeded while reading from socket` exception, which randomly happens on secure connection before timeout actually exceeded and when query profiler is enabled. Also add `connect_timeout_with_failover_secure_ms` settings (default 100ms), which is similar to `connect_timeout_with_failover_ms`, but is used for secure connections (because SSL handshake is slower, than ordinary TCP connection) [#9026](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9026) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix))
* Fix bug with mutations finalization, when mutation may hang in state with `parts_to_do=0` and `is_done=0`. [#9022](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9022) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Use new ANY JOIN logic with `partial_merge_join` setting. It's possible to make `ANY|ALL|SEMI LEFT` and `ALL INNER` joins with `partial_merge_join=1` now. [#8932](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8932) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Shard now clamps the settings got from the initiator to the shard's constaints instead of throwing an exception. This fix allows to send queries to a shard with another constraints. [#9447](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9447) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar))
* Fixed memory management problem in `MergeTreeReadPool`. [#8791](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8791) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon))
* Fix `toDecimal*OrNull()` functions family when called with string `e`. Fixes [#8312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8312) [#8764](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8764) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))

* Fixed the behaviour of `match` and `extract` functions when haystack has zero bytes. The behaviour was wrong when haystack was constant. This fixes [#9160](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9160) [#9163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9163) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)) [#9345](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9345) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))

* Added a check for storage policy in `ATTACH PARTITION FROM`, `REPLACE PARTITION`, `MOVE TO TABLE`. Otherwise it could make data of part inaccessible after restart and prevent ClickHouse to start. [#9383](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9383) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon))
* Fix alters if there is TTL set for table. [#8800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8800) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))

* In previous versions `Memory` database engine use empty data path, so tables are created in `path` directory (e.g. `/var/lib/clickhouse/`), not in data directory of database (e.g. `/var/lib/clickhouse/db_name`). [#8753](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8753) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix))

* Make `reinterpretAsFixedString` to return `FixedString` instead of `String`. [#9052](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9052) ([Andrew Onyshchuk](https://github.com/oandrew))
* Avoid extremely rare cases when the user can get wrong error message (`Success` instead of detailed error description). [#9457](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9457) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Do not crash when using `Template` format with empty row template. [#8785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8785) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm))
* Metadata files for system tables could be created in wrong place [#8653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8653) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)) Fixes [#8581](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8581).
* Fix data race on exception_ptr in cache dictionary [#8303](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8303). [#9379](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9379) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov))
* Do not throw an exception for query `ATTACH TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. Previously it was thrown if table already exists, despite the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause. [#8967](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8967) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))

This fixes [#9491](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9491), closes [#9492](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9492) [#9500](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9500) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Prevent losing data in `Kafka` in rare cases when exception happens after reading suffix but before commit. Fixes [#9378](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9378) [#9507](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9507) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov))

* Fix crash when a user tries to `ALTER MODIFY SETTING` for old-formated `MergeTree` table engines family. [#9435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9435) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Support for UInt64 numbers that don't fit in Int64 in JSON-related functions. Update SIMDJSON to master. This fixes [#9209](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9209) [#9344](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9344) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Fixed execution of inversed predicates when non-strictly monotinic functional index is used. [#9223](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9223) ([Alexander Kazakov](https://github.com/Akazz))

* Fix bug in `ALTER DELETE` mutations which leads to index corruption. This fixes [#9019](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9019) and [#8982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8982). Additionally fix extremely rare race conditions in `ReplicatedMergeTree` `ALTER` queries. [#9048](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9048) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* When the setting `compile_expressions` is enabled, you can get `unexpected column` in `LLVMExecutableFunction` when we use `Nullable` type [#8910](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8910) ([Guillaume Tassery](https://github.com/YiuRULE))
* Multiple fixes for `Kafka` engine: 1) fix duplicates that were appearing during consumer group rebalance. 2) Fix rare 'holes' appeared when data were polled from several partitions with one poll and committed partially (now we always process / commit the whole polled block of messages). 3) Fix flushes by block size (before that only flushing by timeout was working properly). 4) better subscription procedure (with assignment feedback). 5) Make tests work faster (with default intervals and timeouts). Due to the fact that data was not flushed by block size before (as it should according to documentation), that PR may lead to some performance degradation with default settings (due to more often & tinier flushes which are less optimal). If you encounter the performance issue after that change - please increase `kafka_max_block_size` in the table to the bigger value ( for example `CREATE TABLE ...Engine=Kafka ... SETTINGS ... kafka_max_block_size=524288`). Fixes [#7259](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7259) [#8917](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8917) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov))
* Fix `Parameter out of bound` exception in some queries after PREWHERE optimizations. [#8914](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8914) ([Baudouin Giard](https://github.com/bgiard))
* Fixed the case of mixed-constness of arguments of function `arrayZip`. [#8705](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8705) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* When executing `CREATE` query, fold constant expressions in storage engine arguments. Replace empty database name with current database. Fixes [#6508](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6508), [#3492](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/3492) [#9262](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9262) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix))
* Now it's not possible to create or add columns with simple cyclic aliases like `a DEFAULT b, b DEFAULT a`. [#9603](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9603) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Fixed a bug with double move which may corrupt original part. This is relevant if you use `ALTER TABLE MOVE` [#8680](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8680) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon))
* Allow `interval` identifier to correctly parse without backticks. Fixed issue when a query cannot be executed even if the `interval` identifier is enclosed in backticks or double quotes. This fixes [#9124](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9124). [#9142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9142) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Fixed fuzz test and incorrect behaviour of `bitTestAll`/`bitTestAny` functions. [#9143](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9143) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Fix possible crash/wrong number of rows in `LIMIT n WITH TIES` when there are a lot of rows equal to n'th row. [#9464](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9464) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix))
* Fix mutations with parts written with enabled `insert_quorum`. [#9463](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9463) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Fix data race at destruction of `Poco::HTTPServer`. It could happen when server is started and immediately shut down. [#9468](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9468) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))
* Fix bug in which a misleading error message was shown when running `SHOW CREATE TABLE a_table_that_does_not_exist`. [#8899](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8899) ([achulkov2](https://github.com/achulkov2))
* Fixed `Parameters are out of bound` exception in some rare cases when we have a constant in the `SELECT` clause when we have an `ORDER BY` and a `LIMIT` clause. [#8892](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8892) ([Guillaume Tassery](https://github.com/YiuRULE))
* Fix mutations finalization, when already done mutation can have status `is_done=0`. [#9217](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9217) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))

* During server startup do not access table, which `LIVE VIEW` depends on, so server will be able to start. Also remove `LIVE VIEW` dependencies when detaching `LIVE VIEW`. `LIVE VIEW` is an experimental feature. [#8824](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8824) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix))
* Fix possible segfault in `MergeTreeRangeReader`, while executing `PREWHERE`. [#9106](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9106) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))
* Fix possible mismatched checksums with column TTLs. [#9451](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9451) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))
* Fixed a bug when parts were not being moved in background by TTL rules in case when there is only one volume. [#8672](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8672) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon))
* Fixed the issue `Method createColumn() is not implemented for data type Set`. This fixes [#7799](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7799). [#8674](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8674) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Now we will try finalize mutations more frequently. [#9427](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9427) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))

* Fixed error in usage of `min_marks_for_seek` parameter. Fixed the error message when there is no sharding key in Distributed table and we try to skip unused shards. [#8908](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8908) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))

#### Improvement
* Implement `ALTER MODIFY/DROP` queries on top of mutations for `ReplicatedMergeTree*` engines family. Now `ALTERS` blocks only at the metadata update stage, and don't block after that. [#8701](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8701) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Add ability to rewrite CROSS to INNER JOINs with `WHERE` section containing unqialified names. [#9512](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9512) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Make `SHOW TABLES` and `SHOW DATABASES` queries support the `WHERE` expressions and `FROM`/`IN` [#9076](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9076) ([sundyli](https://github.com/sundy-li))
* Added a setting `deduplicate_blocks_in_dependent_materialized_views`. [#9070](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9070) ([urykhy](https://github.com/urykhy))
* After recent changes MySQL client started to print binary strings in hex thereby making them not readable ([#9032](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9032)). The workaround in ClickHouse is to mark string columns as UTF-8, which is not always, but usually the case. [#9079](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9079) ([Yuriy Baranov](https://github.com/yurriy))
* Add support of String and FixedString keys for `sumMap` [#8903](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8903) ([Baudouin Giard](https://github.com/bgiard))
* Support string keys in SummingMergeTree maps [#8933](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8933) ([Baudouin Giard](https://github.com/bgiard))
* Signal termination of thread to the thread pool even if the thread has thrown exception [#8736](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8736) ([Ding Xiang Fei](https://github.com/dingxiangfei2009))
* Allow to set `query_id` in `clickhouse-benchmark` [#9416](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9416) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))
* Don't allow strange expressions in `ALTER TABLE ... PARTITION partition` query. This addresses [#7192](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7192) [#8835](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8835) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* The table `system.table_engines` now provides information about feature support (like `supports_ttl` or `supports_sort_order`). [#8830](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8830) ([Max Akhmedov](https://github.com/zlobober))
* Enable `system.metric_log` by default. It will contain rows with values of ProfileEvents, CurrentMetrics collected with "collect_interval_milliseconds" interval (one second by default). The table is very small (usually in order of megabytes) and collecting this data by default is reasonable. [#9225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9225) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Initialize query profiler for all threads in a group, e.g. it allows to fully profile insert-queries. Fixes [#6964](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6964) [#8874](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8874) ([Ivan](https://github.com/abyss7))
* Now temporary `LIVE VIEW` is created by `CREATE LIVE VIEW name WITH TIMEOUT [42] ...` instead of `CREATE TEMPORARY LIVE VIEW ...`, because the previous syntax was not consistent with `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ...` [#9131](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9131) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix))
* Add text_log.level configuration parameter to limit entries that goes to `system.text_log` table [#8809](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8809) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))
* Allow to put downloaded part to a disks/volumes according to TTL rules [#8598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8598) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon))
* For external MySQL dictionaries, allow to mutualize MySQL connection pool to "share" them among dictionaries. This option significantly reduces the number of connections to MySQL servers. [#9409](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9409) ([Clément Rodriguez](https://github.com/clemrodriguez))
* Show nearest query execution time for quantiles in `clickhouse-benchmark` output instead of interpolated values. It's better to show values that correspond to the execution time of some queries. [#8712](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8712) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Possibility to add key & timestamp for the message when inserting data to Kafka. Fixes [#7198](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7198) [#8969](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8969) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov))
* If server is run from terminal, highlight thread number, query id and log priority by colors. This is for improved readability of correlated log messages for developers. [#8961](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8961) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Better exception message while loading tables for `Ordinary` database. [#9527](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9527) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Implement `arraySlice` for arrays with aggregate function states. This fixes [#9388](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9388) [#9391](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9391) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Allow constant functions and constant arrays to be used on the right side of IN operator. [#8813](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8813) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))
* If zookeeper exception has happened while fetching data for system.replicas, display it in a separate column.

[#9070](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9070) [(urykhy)](https://github.com/urykhy)

### ClickHouse release v20.1.2.4, 2020-01-22

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Make the setting `merge_tree_uniform_read_distribution` obsolete. The server still recognizes this setting but it has no effect. [#8308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8308) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Changed return type of the function `greatCircleDistance` to `Float32` because now the result of calculation is `Float32`. [#7993](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7993) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Now it's expected that query parameters are represented in "escaped" format. For example, to pass string `a<tab>b` you have to write `a\tb` or `a\<tab>b` and respectively, `a%5Ctb` or `a%5C%09b` in URL. This is needed to add the possibility to pass NULL as `\N`. This fixes [#7488](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7488). [#8517](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8517) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Enable `use_minimalistic_part_header_in_zookeeper` setting for `ReplicatedMergeTree` by default. This will significantly reduce amount of data stored in ZooKeeper. This setting is supported since version 19.1 and we already use it in production in multiple services without any issues for more than half a year. Disable this setting if you have a chance to downgrade to versions older than 19.1. [#6850](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/6850) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Data skipping indices are production ready and enabled by default. The settings `allow_experimental_data_skipping_indices`, `allow_experimental_cross_to_join_conversion` and `allow_experimental_multiple_joins_emulation` are now obsolete and do nothing. [#7974](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7974) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Add new `ANY JOIN` logic for `StorageJoin` consistent with `JOIN` operation. To upgrade without changes in behaviour you need add `SETTINGS any_join_distinct_right_table_keys = 1` to Engine Join tables metadata or recreate these tables after upgrade. [#8400](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8400) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Require server to be restarted to apply the changes in logging configuration. This is a temporary workaround to avoid the bug where the server logs to a deleted log file (see [#8696](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8696)). [#8707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8707) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm))

* Improvements in consistency of `ANY JOIN` logic. Now `t1 ANY LEFT JOIN t2` equals `t2 ANY RIGHT JOIN t1`. [#7665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7665) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Add setting `any_join_distinct_right_table_keys` which enables old behaviour for `ANY INNER JOIN`. [#7665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7665) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Add new `SEMI` and `ANTI JOIN`. Old `ANY INNER JOIN` behaviour now available as `SEMI LEFT JOIN`. [#7665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7665) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Added `Distributed` format for `File` engine and `file` table function which allows to read from `.bin` files generated by asynchronous  inserts into `Distributed` table. [#8535](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8535) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai))
* Add optional reset column argument for `runningAccumulate` which allows to reset aggregation results for each new key value. [#8326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8326) ([Sergey Kononenko](https://github.com/kononencheg))
* Add ability to use ClickHouse as Prometheus endpoint. [#7900](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7900) ([vdimir](https://github.com/Vdimir))
* Add section `<remote_url_allow_hosts>` in `config.xml` which restricts allowed hosts for remote table engines and table functions `URL`, `S3`, `HDFS`. [#7154](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7154) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb))
* Added function `greatCircleAngle` which calculates the distance on a sphere in degrees. [#8105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8105) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Changed Earth radius to be consistent with H3 library. [#8105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8105) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Added `JSONCompactEachRow` and `JSONCompactEachRowWithNamesAndTypes` formats for input and output. [#7841](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7841) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb))
* Added feature for file-related table engines and table functions (`File`, `S3`, `URL`, `HDFS`) which allows to read and write `gzip` files based on additional engine parameter or file extension. [#7840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7840) ([Andrey Bodrov](https://github.com/apbodrov))
* Added the `randomASCII(length)` function, generating a string with a random set of [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters) printable characters. [#8401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8401) ([BayoNet](https://github.com/BayoNet))
* Added function `JSONExtractArrayRaw` which returns an array on unparsed json array elements from `JSON` string. [#8081](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8081) ([Oleg Matrokhin](https://github.com/errx))
* Add `arrayZip` function which allows to combine multiple arrays of equal lengths into one array of tuples. [#8149](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8149) ([Winter Zhang](https://github.com/zhang2014))
