# 2023 Changelog

### <a id="232"></a> ClickHouse release 23.2, 2023-02-23

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Extend function "toDayOfWeek()" (alias: "DAYOFWEEK") with a mode argument that encodes whether the week starts on Monday or Sunday and whether counting starts at 0 or 1. For consistency with other date time functions, the mode argument was inserted between the time and the time zone arguments. This breaks existing usage of the (previously undocumented) 2-argument syntax "toDayOfWeek(time, time_zone)". A fix is to rewrite the function into "toDayOfWeek(time, 0, time_zone)". [#45233](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45233) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Rename setting `max_query_cache_size` to `filesystem_cache_max_download_size`. [#45614](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45614) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* The default user will not have permissions for access type `SHOW NAMED COLLECTION` by default (e.g. by default, default user will not longer be able to do grant ALL to other users as it was before, therefore this PR is backward incompatible). [#46010](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46010) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* If the SETTINGS clause is specified before the FORMAT clause, the settings will be applied to formatting as well. [#46003](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46003) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Remove support for setting `materialized_postgresql_allow_automatic_update` (which was by default turned off). Fix integration tests. [#46106](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46106) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Slightly improve performance of `countDigits` on realistic datasets. This closed [#44518](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44518). In previous versions, `countDigits(0)` returned `0`; now it returns `1`, which is more correct, and follows the existing documentation. [#46187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46187) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Disallow creation of new columns compressed by a combination of codecs "Delta" or "DoubleDelta" followed by codecs "Gorilla" or "FPC". This can be bypassed using setting "allow_suspicious_codecs = true". [#45652](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45652) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

#### New Feature
* Add `StorageIceberg` and table function `iceberg` to access iceberg table store on S3. [#45384](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45384) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Allow configuring storage as `SETTINGS disk = '<disk_name>'` (instead of `storage_policy`) and with explicit disk creation `SETTINGS disk = disk(type=s3, ...)`. [#41976](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41976) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Expose `ProfileEvents` counters in `system.part_log`. [#38614](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38614) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Enrichment of the existing `ReplacingMergeTree` engine to allow duplicate the insertion. It leverages the power of both `ReplacingMergeTree` and `CollapsingMergeTree` in one MergeTree engine. Deleted data are not returned when queried, but not removed from disk neither. [#41005](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41005) ([youennL-cs](https://github.com/youennL-cs)).
* Add `generateULID` function. Closes [#36536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36536). [#44662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44662) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Add `corrMatrix` aggregate function, calculating each two columns. In addition, since Aggregatefunctions `covarSamp` and `covarPop` are similar to `corr`, I add `covarSampMatrix`, `covarPopMatrix` by the way. @alexey-milovidov closes [#44587](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44587). [#44680](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44680) ([FFFFFFFHHHHHHH](https://github.com/FFFFFFFHHHHHHH)).
* Introduce arrayShuffle function for random array permutations. [#45271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45271) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Support types `FIXED_SIZE_BINARY` type in Arrow, `FIXED_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAY` in `Parquet` and match them to `FixedString`. Add settings `output_format_parquet_fixed_string_as_fixed_byte_array/output_format_arrow_fixed_string_as_fixed_byte_array` to control default output type for FixedString. Closes [#45326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45326). [#45340](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45340) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add a new column `last_exception_time` to system.replication_queue. [#45457](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45457) ([Frank Chen](https://github.com/FrankChen021)).
* Add two new functions which allow for user-defined keys/seeds with SipHash{64,128}. [#45513](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45513) ([Salvatore Mesoraca](https://github.com/aiven-sal)).
* Allow a three-argument version for table function `format`. close [#45808](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45808). [#45873](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45873) ([FFFFFFFHHHHHHH](https://github.com/FFFFFFFHHHHHHH)).
* add `JodaTime` format support for 'x','w','S'. Refer to https://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html. [#46073](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46073) ([zk_kiger](https://github.com/zk-kiger)).
* Support window function `ntile`.
* Add setting `final` to implicitly apply the `FINAL` modifier to every table. [#40945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40945) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Added `arrayPartialSort` and `arrayPartialReverseSort` functions. [#46296](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46296) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* The new http parameter `client_protocol_version` allows setting a client protocol version for HTTP responses using the Native format. [#40397](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40397). [#46360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46360) ([Geoff Genz](https://github.com/genzgd)).
* Add new function `regexpExtract`, like spark function `REGEXP_EXTRACT` for compatibility. It is similar to the existing function `extract`. [#46469](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46469) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add new function `JSONArrayLength`, which returns the number of elements in the outermost JSON array. The function returns NULL if the input JSON string is invalid. [#46631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46631) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).

#### Performance Improvement
* The introduced logic works if PREWHERE condition is a conjunction of multiple conditions (cond1 AND cond2 AND ... ). It groups those conditions that require reading the same columns into steps. After each step the corresponding part of the full condition is computed and the result rows might be filtered. This allows to read fewer rows in the next steps thus saving IO bandwidth and doing less computation. This logic is disabled by default for now. It will be enabled by default in one of the future releases once it is known to not have any regressions, so it is highly encouraged to be used for testing. It can be controlled by 2 settings: "enable_multiple_prewhere_read_steps" and "move_all_conditions_to_prewhere". [#46140](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46140) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* An option added to aggregate partitions independently if table partition key and group by key are compatible. Controlled by the setting `allow_aggregate_partitions_independently`. Disabled by default because of limited applicability (please refer to the docs). [#45364](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45364) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Allow using Vertical merge algorithm with parts in Compact format. This will allow ClickHouse server to use much less memory for background operations. This closes [#46084](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46084). [#45681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45681) [#46282](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46282) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Optimize `Parquet` reader by using batch reader. [#45878](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45878) ([LiuNeng](https://github.com/liuneng1994)).
* Add new `local_filesystem_read_method` method `io_uring` based on the asynchronous Linux [io_uring](https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf) subsystem, improving read performance almost universally compared to the default `pread` method. [#38456](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38456) ([Saulius Valatka](https://github.com/sauliusvl)).
* Rewrite aggregate functions with `if` expression as argument when logically equivalent. For example, `avg(if(cond, col, null))` can be rewritten to avgIf(cond, col). It is helpful in performance. [#44730](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44730) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improve lower/upper function performance with avx512 instructions. [#37894](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37894) ([yaqi-zhao](https://github.com/yaqi-zhao)).
* Remove the limitation that on systems with >=32 cores and SMT disabled ClickHouse uses only half of the cores (the case when you disable Hyper Threading in BIOS). [#44973](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44973) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Improve performance of function `multiIf` by columnar executing, speed up by 2.3x. [#45296](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45296) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add fast path for function `position` when the needle is empty. [#45382](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45382) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Enable `query_plan_remove_redundant_sorting` optimization by default. Optimization implemented in [#45420](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45420). [#45567](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45567) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Increased HTTP Transfer Encoding chunk size to improve performance of large queries using the HTTP interface. [#45593](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45593) ([Geoff Genz](https://github.com/genzgd)).
* Fixed performance of short `SELECT` queries that read from tables with large number of `Array`/`Map`/`Nested` columns. [#45630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45630) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improve performance of filtering for big integers and decimal types. [#45949](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45949) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* This change could effectively reduce the overhead of obtaining the filter from ColumnNullable(UInt8) and improve the overall query performance. To evaluate the impact of this change, we adopted TPC-H benchmark but revised the column types from non-nullable to nullable, and we measured the QPS of its queries as the performance indicator. [#45962](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45962) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Make the `_part` and `_partition_id` virtual column be `LowCardinality(String)` type. Closes [#45964](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45964). [#45975](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45975) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Improve the performance of Decimal conversion when the scale does not change. [#46095](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46095) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow to increase prefetching for read data. [#46168](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46168) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Rewrite `arrayExists(x -> x = 1, arr)` -> `has(arr, 1)`, which improve performance by 1.34x. [#46188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46188) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Fix too big memory usage for vertical merges on non-remote disk. Respect `max_insert_delayed_streams_for_parallel_write` for the remote disk. [#46275](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46275) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Update zstd to v1.5.4. It has some minor improvements in performance and compression ratio. If you run replicas with different versions of ClickHouse you may see reasonable error messages `Data after merge/mutation is not byte-identical to data on another replicas.` with explanation. These messages are Ok and you should not worry. [#46280](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46280) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Fix performance degradation caused by [#39737](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39737). [#46309](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46309) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `replicas_status` handle will answer quickly even in case of a large replication queue. [#46310](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46310) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add avx512 support for aggregate function `sum`, function unary arithmetic, function comparison. [#37870](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37870) ([zhao zhou](https://github.com/zzachimed)).
* Rewrote the code around marks distribution and the overall coordination of the reading in order to achieve the maximum performance improvement. This closes [#34527](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34527). [#43772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43772) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Remove redundant DISTINCT clauses in query (subqueries). Implemented on top of query plan. It does similar optimization as `optimize_duplicate_order_by_and_distinct` regarding DISTINCT clauses. Can be enabled via `query_plan_remove_redundant_distinct` setting. Related to [#42648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42648). [#44176](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44176) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* A few query rewrite optimizations: `sumIf(123, cond) -> 123 * countIf(1, cond)`, `sum(if(cond, 123, 0)) -> 123 * countIf(cond)`, `sum(if(cond, 0, 123)) -> 123 * countIf(not(cond))` [#44728](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44728) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improved how memory bound merging and aggregation in order on top query plan interact. Previously we fell back to explicit sorting for AIO in some cases when it wasn't actually needed. [#45892](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45892) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Concurrent merges are scheduled using round-robin by default to ensure fair and starvation-free operation. Previously in heavily overloaded shards, big merges could possibly be starved by smaller merges due to the use of strict priority scheduling. Added `background_merges_mutations_scheduling_policy` server config option to select scheduling algorithm (`round_robin` or `shortest_task_first`). [#46247](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46247) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).

#### Improvement
* Enable retries for INSERT by default in case of ZooKeeper session loss. We already use it in production. [#46308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46308) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add ability to ignore unknown keys in JSON object for named tuples (`input_format_json_ignore_unknown_keys_in_named_tuple`). [#45678](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45678) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Support optimizing the `where` clause with sorting key expression move to `prewhere`  for query with `final`. [#38893](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38893). [#38950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38950) ([hexiaoting](https://github.com/hexiaoting)).
* Add new metrics for backups: num_processed_files and processed_files_size described actual number of processed files. [#42244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42244) ([Aleksandr](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).
* Added retries on interserver DNS errors. [#43179](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43179) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* Keeper improvement: try preallocating space on the disk to avoid undefined out-of-space issues. Introduce setting `max_log_file_size` for the maximum size of Keeper's Raft log files. [#44370](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44370) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Optimize behavior for a replica delay api logic in case the replica is read-only. [#45148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45148) ([mateng915](https://github.com/mateng0915)).
* Ask for the password in clickhouse-client interactively in a case when the empty password is wrong. Closes [#46702](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46702). [#46730](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46730) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)). 
* Mark `Gorilla` compression on columns of non-Float* type as suspicious. [#45376](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45376) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Show replica name that is executing a merge in the `postpone_reason` column. [#45458](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45458) ([Frank Chen](https://github.com/FrankChen021)).
* Save exception stack trace in part_log. [#45459](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45459) ([Frank Chen](https://github.com/FrankChen021)).
* The `regexp_tree` dictionary is polished and now it is compatible with https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core. [#45631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45631) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Updated checking of `SYSTEM SYNC REPLICA`, resolves [#45508](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45508) [#45648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45648) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Rename setting `replication_alter_partitions_sync` to `alter_sync`. [#45659](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45659) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* The `generateRandom` table function and the engine now support `LowCardinality` data types. This is useful for testing, for example you can write `INSERT INTO table SELECT * FROM generateRandom() LIMIT 1000`. This is needed to debug [#45590](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45590). [#45661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45661) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The experimental query result cache now provides more modular configuration settings. [#45679](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45679) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Renamed "query result cache" to "query cache". [#45682](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45682) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* add `SYSTEM SYNC FILE CACHE` command. It will do the `sync` syscall. [#8921](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8921). [#45685](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45685) ([DR](https://github.com/freedomDR)).
* Add a new S3 setting `allow_head_object_request`. This PR makes usage of `GetObjectAttributes` request instead of `HeadObject` introduced in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45288 optional (and disabled by default). [#45701](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45701) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add ability to override connection settings based on connection names (that said that now you can forget about storing password for each connection, you can simply put everything into `~/.clickhouse-client/config.xml` and even use different history files for them, which can be also useful). [#45715](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45715) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Arrow format: support the duration type. Closes [#45669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45669). [#45750](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45750) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Extend the logging in the Query Cache to improve investigations of the caching behavior. [#45751](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45751) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* The query cache's server-level settings are now reconfigurable at runtime. [#45758](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45758) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Hide password in logs when a table function's arguments are specified with a named collection. [#45774](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45774) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Improve internal S3 client to correctly deduce regions and redirections for different types of URLs. [#45783](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45783) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add support for Map, IPv4 and IPv6 types in generateRandom. Mostly useful for testing. [#45785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45785) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Support empty/notEmpty for IP types. [#45799](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45799) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* The column `num_processed_files` was split into two columns: `num_files` (for BACKUP) and `files_read` (for RESTORE). The column `processed_files_size` was split into two columns: `total_size` (for BACKUP) and `bytes_read` (for RESTORE). [#45800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45800) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add support for `SHOW ENGINES` query for MySQL compatibility. [#45859](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45859) ([Filatenkov Artur](https://github.com/FArthur-cmd)).
* Improved how the obfuscator deals with queries. [#45867](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45867) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improve behaviour of conversion into Date for boundary value 65535 (2149-06-06). [#46042](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46042) [#45914](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45914) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Add setting `check_referential_table_dependencies` to check referential dependencies on `DROP TABLE`. This PR solves [#38326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38326). [#45936](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45936) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Fix `tupleElement` to return `Null` when having `Null` argument. Closes [#45894](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45894). [#45952](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45952) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Throw an error on no files satisfying the S3 wildcard. Closes [#45587](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45587). [#45957](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45957) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Use cluster state data to check concurrent backup/restore. [#45982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45982) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* ClickHouse Client: Use "exact" matching for fuzzy search, which has correct case ignorance and more appropriate algorithm for matching SQL queries. [#46000](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46000) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Forbid wrong create View syntax `CREATE View X TO Y AS SELECT`. Closes [#4331](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4331). [#46043](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46043) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Storage `Log` family support setting the `storage_policy`. Closes [#43421](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43421). [#46044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46044) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Improve `JSONColumns` format when the result is empty. Closes [#46024](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46024). [#46053](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46053) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Add reference implementation for SipHash128. [#46065](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46065) ([Salvatore Mesoraca](https://github.com/aiven-sal)).
* Add a new metric to record allocations times and bytes using mmap. [#46068](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46068) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Currently for functions like `leftPad`, `rightPad`, `leftPadUTF8`, `rightPadUTF8`, the second argument `length` must be UInt8|16|32|64|128|256. Which is too strict for clickhouse users, besides, it is not consistent with other similar functions like `arrayResize`, `substring` and so on. [#46103](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46103) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Fix assertion in the `welchTTest` function in debug build when the resulting statistics is NaN. Unified the behavior with other similar functions. Change the behavior of `studentTTest` to return NaN instead of throwing an exception because the previous behavior was inconvenient. This closes [#41176](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41176) This closes [#42162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42162). [#46141](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46141) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* More convenient usage of big integers and ORDER BY WITH FILL. Allow using plain integers for start and end points in WITH FILL when ORDER BY big (128-bit and 256-bit) integers. Fix the wrong result for big integers with negative start or end points. This closes [#16733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16733). [#46152](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46152) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add `parts`, `active_parts` and `total_marks` columns to `system.tables` on [issue](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44336). [#46161](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46161) ([attack204](https://github.com/attack204)).
* Functions "multi[Fuzzy]Match(Any|AnyIndex|AllIndices}" now reject regexes which will likely evaluate very slowly in vectorscan. [#46167](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46167) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* When `insert_null_as_default` is enabled and column doesn't have defined default value, the default of column type will be used. Also this PR fixes using default values on nulls in case of LowCardinality columns. [#46171](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46171) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Prefer explicitly defined access keys for S3 clients. If `use_environment_credentials` is set to `true`, and the user has provided the access key through query or config, they will be used instead of the ones from the environment variable. [#46191](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46191) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add an alias "DATE_FORMAT()" for function "formatDateTime()" to improve compatibility with MySQL's SQL dialect, extend function `formatDateTime` with substitutions "a", "b", "c", "h", "i", "k", "l" "r", "s", "W". ### Documentation entry for user-facing changes User-readable short description: `DATE_FORMAT` is an alias of `formatDateTime`. Formats a Time according to the given Format string. Format is a constant expression, so you cannot have multiple formats for a single result column. (Provide link to [formatDateTime](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/date-time-functions/#formatdatetime)). [#46302](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46302) ([Jake Bamrah](https://github.com/JakeBamrah)).
* Add `ProfileEvents` and `CurrentMetrics` about the callback tasks for parallel replicas (`s3Cluster` and `MergeTree` tables). [#46313](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46313) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add support for `DELETE` and `UPDATE` for tables using `KeeperMap` storage engine. [#46330](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46330) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).

* Exclude the internal database used for temporary/external tables from the calculation of asynchronous metric "NumberOfDatabases". This makes the behavior consistent with system table "system.databases". [#46435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46435) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Added `last_exception_time` column into distribution_queue table. [#46564](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46564) ([Aleksandr](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).
* Support for IN clause with parameter in parameterized views. [#46583](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46583) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Do not load named collections on server startup (load them on first access instead). [#46607](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46607) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

* If the environment variable `CLICKHOUSE_DOCKER_RESTART_ON_EXIT` is set to 1, the Docker container will run `clickhouse-server` as a child instead of the first process, and restart it when it exited. [#46391](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46391) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* When the callback in the cache is called, it is possible that this cache is destructed. To keep it safe, we capture members by value. It's also safe for task schedule because it will be deactivated before storage is destroyed. Resolve [#45548](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45548). [#45601](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45601) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).

* Set compression method and level for backup Closes [#45690](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45690). [#45737](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45737) ([Pradeep Chhetri](https://github.com/chhetripradeep)).
* Should use `select_query_typed.limitByOffset()` instead of `select_query_typed.limitOffset()`. [#45817](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45817) ([刘陶峰](https://github.com/taofengliu)).
* When use experimental analyzer, queries like `SELECT number FROM numbers(100) LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;` get wrong results (empty result for this sql). That is caused by an unnecessary offset step added by planner. [#45822](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45822) ([刘陶峰](https://github.com/taofengliu)).
* Backward compatibility - allow implicit narrowing conversion from UInt64 to IPv4 - required for "INSERT ... VALUES ..." expression. [#45865](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45865) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).

* Add the `query_kind` column to the `system.processes` table and the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` query. Remove duplicate code. It fixes a bug: the global configuration parameter `max_concurrent_select_queries` was not respected to queries with `INTERSECT` or `EXCEPT` chains. [#45872](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45872) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### <a id="231"></a> ClickHouse release 23.1, 2023-01-26

### ClickHouse release 23.1

#### Upgrade Notes
* The `SYSTEM RESTART DISK` query becomes a no-op. [#44647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44647) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* The `PREALLOCATE` option for `HASHED`/`SPARSE_HASHED` dictionaries becomes a no-op. [#45388](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45388) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)). It does not give significant advantages anymore.
* Disallow `Gorilla` codec on columns of non-Float32 or non-Float64 type. [#45252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45252) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)). It was pointless and led to inconsistencies. 
* Parallel quorum inserts might work incorrectly with `*MergeTree` tables created with the deprecated syntax. Therefore, parallel quorum inserts support is completely disabled for such tables. It does not affect tables created with a new syntax. [#45430](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45430) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Use the `GetObjectAttributes` request instead of the `HeadObject` request to get the size of an object in AWS S3. This change fixes handling endpoints without explicit regions after updating the AWS SDK, for example. [#45288](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45288) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)). AWS S3 and Minio are tested, but keep in mind that various S3-compatible services (GCS, R2, B2) may have subtle incompatibilities. This change also may require you to adjust the ACL to allow the `GetObjectAttributes` request.
* Forbid paths in timezone names. For example, a timezone name like `/usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Aden` is not allowed; the IANA timezone database name like `Asia/Aden` should be used. [#44225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44225) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Queries combining equijoin and constant expressions (e.g., `JOIN ON t1.x = t2.x AND 1 = 1`) are forbidden due to incorrect results. [#44016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44016) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).


#### New Feature
* Dictionary source for extracting keys by traversing regular expressions tree. It can be used for User-Agent parsing. [#40878](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40878) ([Vage Ogannisian](https://github.com/nooblose)). [#43858](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43858) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Added parametrized view functionality, now it's possible to specify query parameters for the View table engine. resolves [#40907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40907). [#41687](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41687) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add `quantileInterpolatedWeighted`/`quantilesInterpolatedWeighted` functions. [#38252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38252) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Array join support for the `Map` type, like the function "explode" in Spark. [#43239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43239) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Support SQL standard binary and hex string literals. [#43785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43785) ([Mo Xuan](https://github.com/mo-avatar)).
* Allow formatting `DateTime` in Joda-Time style. Refer to [the Joda-Time docs](https://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html). [#43818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43818) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Implemented a fractional second formatter (`%f`) for `formatDateTime`. [#44060](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44060) ([ltrk2](https://github.com/ltrk2)). [#44497](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44497) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Added `age` function to calculate the difference between two dates or dates with time values expressed as the number of full units. Closes [#41115](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41115). [#44421](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44421) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Add `Null` source for dictionaries. Closes [#44240](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44240). [#44502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44502) ([mayamika](https://github.com/mayamika)).
* Allow configuring the S3 storage class with the `s3_storage_class` configuration option. Such as `<s3_storage_class>STANDARD/INTELLIGENT_TIERING</s3_storage_class>` Closes [#44443](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44443). [#44707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44707) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Insert default values in case of missing elements in JSON object while parsing named tuple. Add setting `input_format_json_defaults_for_missing_elements_in_named_tuple` that controls this behaviour. Closes [#45142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45142)#issuecomment-1380153217. [#45231](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45231) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Record server startup time in ProfileEvents (`ServerStartupMilliseconds`). Resolves [#43188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43188). [#45250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45250) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Refactor and Improve streaming engines Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS and add support for all formats, also refactor formats a bit: - Fix producing messages in row-based formats with suffixes/prefixes. Now every message is formatted completely with all delimiters and can be parsed back using input format. - Support block-based formats like Native, Parquet, ORC, etc. Every block is formatted as a separate message. The number of rows in one message depends on the block size, so you can control it via the setting `max_block_size`. - Add new engine settings `kafka_max_rows_per_message/rabbitmq_max_rows_per_message/nats_max_rows_per_message`. They control the number of rows formatted in one message in row-based formats. Default value: 1. - Fix high memory consumption in the NATS table engine. - Support arbitrary binary data in NATS producer (previously it worked only with strings contained \0 at the end) - Add missing Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS engine settings in the documentation. - Refactor producing and consuming in Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS, separate it from WriteBuffers/ReadBuffers semantic. - Refactor output formats: remove callbacks on each row used in Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS (now we don't use callbacks there), allow to use IRowOutputFormat directly, clarify row end and row between delimiters, make it possible to reset output format to start formatting again - Add proper implementation in formatRow function (bonus after formats refactoring). [#42777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42777) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support reading/writing `Nested` tables as `List` of `Struct` in `CapnProto` format. Read/write `Decimal32/64` as `Int32/64`. Closes [#43319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43319). [#43379](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43379) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Added a `message_format_string` column to `system.text_log`. The column contains a pattern that was used to format the message. [#44543](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44543) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)). This allows various analytics over the ClickHouse logs.
* Try to autodetect headers with column names (and maybe types) for CSV/TSV/CustomSeparated input formats.
Add settings input_format_tsv/csv/custom_detect_header that enable this behaviour (enabled by default). Closes [#44640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44640). [#44953](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44953) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Add an experimental inverted index as a new secondary index type for efficient text search. [#38667](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38667) ([larryluogit](https://github.com/larryluogit)).
* Add experimental query result cache. [#43797](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43797) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Added extendable and configurable scheduling subsystem for IO requests (not yet integrated with IO code itself). [#41840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41840) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)). This feature does nothing at all, enjoy.
* Added `SYSTEM DROP DATABASE REPLICA` that removes metadata of a dead replica of a `Replicated` database. Resolves [#41794](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41794). [#42807](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42807) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Do not load inactive parts at startup of `MergeTree` tables. [#42181](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42181) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improved latency of reading from storage `S3` and table function `s3` with large numbers of small files. Now settings `remote_filesystem_read_method` and `remote_filesystem_read_prefetch` take effect while reading from storage `S3`. [#43726](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43726) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Optimization for reading struct fields in Parquet/ORC files. Only the required fields are loaded. [#44484](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44484) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Two-level aggregation algorithm was mistakenly disabled for queries over the HTTP interface. It was enabled back, and it leads to a major performance improvement. [#45450](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45450) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Added mmap support for StorageFile, which should improve the performance of clickhouse-local. [#43927](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43927) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Added sharding support in HashedDictionary to allow parallel load (almost linear scaling based on number of shards). [#40003](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40003) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Speed up query parsing. [#42284](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42284) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Always replace OR chain `expr = x1 OR ... OR expr = xN` to `expr IN (x1, ..., xN)` in the case where `expr` is a `LowCardinality` column. Setting `optimize_min_equality_disjunction_chain_length` is ignored in this case. [#42889](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42889) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).
* Slightly improve performance by optimizing the code around ThreadStatus. [#43586](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43586) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Optimize the column-wise ternary logic evaluation by achieving auto-vectorization. In the performance test of this [microbenchmark](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh/ClickHouse/blob/20221123-ternary-logic-opt-example/src/Functions/examples/associative_applier_perf.cpp), we've observed a peak **performance gain** of **21x** on the ICX device (Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 CPU). [#43669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43669) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Avoid acquiring read locks in the `system.tables` table if possible. [#43840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43840) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Optimize ThreadPool. The performance experiments of SSB (Star Schema Benchmark) on the ICX device (Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 CPU, 80 cores, 160 threads) shows that this change could effectively decrease the lock contention for ThreadPoolImpl::mutex by **75%**, increasing the CPU utilization and improving the overall performance by **2.4%**. [#44308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44308) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Now the optimisation for predicting the hash table size is applied only if the cached hash table size is sufficiently large (thresholds were determined empirically and hardcoded). [#44455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44455) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Small performance improvement for asynchronous reading from remote filesystems. [#44868](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44868) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add fast path for: - `col like '%%'`; - `col like '%'`; - `col not like '%'`; - `col not like '%'`; - `match(col, '.*')`. [#45244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45244) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Slightly improve happy path optimisation in filtering (WHERE clause). [#45289](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45289) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Provide monotonicity info for `toUnixTimestamp64*` to enable more algebraic optimizations for index analysis. [#44116](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44116) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Allow the configuration of temporary data for query processing (spilling to disk) to cooperate with the filesystem cache (taking up the space from the cache disk) [#43972](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43972) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)). This mainly improves [ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.cloud/), but can be used for self-managed setups as well, if you know what to do.
* Make `system.replicas` table do parallel fetches of replicas statuses. Closes [#43918](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43918). [#43998](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43998) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Optimize memory consumption during backup to S3: files to S3 now will be copied directly without using `WriteBufferFromS3` (which could use a lot of memory). [#45188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45188) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add a cache for async block ids. This will reduce the number of requests of ZooKeeper when we enable async inserts deduplication. [#45106](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45106) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).

[#43695](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43695) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add support for signed arguments in the function `range`. Fixes [#43333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43333). [#43733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43733) ([sanyu](https://github.com/wineternity)).
* Remove redundant sorting, for example, sorting related ORDER BY clauses in subqueries. Implemented on top of query plan. It does similar optimization as `optimize_duplicate_order_by_and_distinct` regarding `ORDER BY` clauses, but more generic, since it's applied to any redundant sorting steps (not only caused by ORDER BY clause) and applied to subqueries of any depth. Related to [#42648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42648). [#43905](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43905) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Add the ability to disable deduplication of files for BACKUP (for backups without deduplication ATTACH can be used instead of full RESTORE). For example `BACKUP foo TO S3(...) SETTINGS deduplicate_files=0` (default `deduplicate_files=1`). [#43947](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43947) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Refactor and improve schema inference for text formats. Add new setting `schema_inference_make_columns_nullable` that controls making result types `Nullable` (enabled by default);. [#44019](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44019) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Better support for `PROXYv1` protocol. [#44135](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44135) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).

* Add a user-level setting `database_replicated_allow_replicated_engine_arguments` which allows banning the creation of `ReplicatedMergeTree` tables with arguments in `DatabaseReplicated`. [#44566](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44566) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Prevent users from mistakenly specifying zero (invalid) value for `index_granularity`. This closes [#44536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44536). [#44578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44578) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added possibility to set path to service keytab file in `keytab` parameter in `kerberos` section of config.xml. [#44594](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44594) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).

* Enable `input_format_json_read_objects_as_strings` by default to be able to read nested JSON objects while JSON Object type is experimental. [#44657](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44657) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Improvement for deduplication of async inserts: when users do duplicate async inserts, we should deduplicate inside the memory before we query Keeper. [#44682](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44682) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Input/ouptut `Avro` format will parse bool type as ClickHouse bool type. [#44684](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44684) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support Bool type in Arrow/Parquet/ORC. Closes [#43970](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43970). [#44698](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44698) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

For internal requests, it checks if it is from the self node using backup_uuid. [#45072](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45072) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add `<storage_policy>` config parameter for system logs. [#45320](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45320) ([Stig Bakken](https://github.com/stigsb)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement

* Previously the `bar` function used the same '▋' (U+258B "Left five eighths block") character to display both 5/8 and 6/8 bars. This change corrects this behavior by using '▊' (U+258A "Left three quarters block") for displaying 6/8 bar. [#44410](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44410) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).

* Don't execute and/or/if/multiIf on a LowCardinality dictionary, so the result type cannot be LowCardinality. It could lead to the error `Illegal column ColumnLowCardinality` in some cases. Fixes [#43603](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43603). [#44469](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44469) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

[#44781](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44781) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* A rare race condition was possible when querying the `system.parts` or `system.parts_columns` tables in the presence of parts being moved between disks. Introduced in [#41145](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41145). [#44809](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44809) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Delay for INSERT can be calculated incorrectly, which can lead to always using `max_delay_to_insert` setting as delay instead of a correct value. Using simple formula `max_delay_to_insert * (parts_over_threshold/max_allowed_parts_over_threshold)` i.e. delay grows proportionally to parts over threshold. Closes [#44902](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44902). [#44954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44954) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
