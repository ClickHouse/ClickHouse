# 2025 Changelog

### <a id="251"></a> ClickHouse release 25.1, 2025-01-28

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* `JSONEachRowWithProgress` will write the progress whenever the progress happens. In previous versions, the progress was shown only after each block of the result, which made it useless. Change the way how the progress is displayed: it will not show zero values. This closes [#70800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70800). [#73834](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73834) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `Merge` tables will unify the structure of underlying tables by using a union of their columns and deriving common types. This closes [#64864](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64864). In certain cases, this change could be backward incompatible. One example is when there is no common type between tables, but conversion to the type of the first table is still possible, such as in the case of UInt64 and Int64 or any numeric type and String. If you want to return to the old behavior, set `merge_table_max_tables_to_look_for_schema_inference` to `1` or set `compatibility` to `24.12` or earlier. [#73956](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73956) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Parquet output format converts Date and DateTime columns to date/time types supported by Parquet, instead of writing them as raw numbers. `DateTime` becomes `ateTime64(3)` (was: `UInt32`); setting `output_format_parquet_datetime_as_uint32` brings back the old behavior. `Date` becomes `Date32` (was: `UInt16`). [#70950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70950) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Don't allow not comparable types (like `JSON`/`Object`/`AggregateFunction`) in `ORDER BY` and comparison functions `less/greater/equal/etc` by default. [#73276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73276) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* The obsolete `MaterializedMySQL` database engine has been removed and is no longer available. [#73879](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73879) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `mysql` dictionary source no longer does `SHOW TABLE STATUS` query, because it does not provide any value for InnoDB tables, as long as for any recent MySQL versions. This closes [#72636](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72636). This change is backward compatible, but put in this category so you have a chance to notice it. [#73914](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73914) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `CHECK TABLE` queries now require a separate, `CHECK` grant. In previous versions, it was enough to have `SHOW TABLES` grant to run these queries. But a `CHECK TABLE` query can be heavy, and usual query complexity limits for `SELECT` queries don't apply to it. It led to the potential of DoS. [#74471](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74471) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Function `h3ToGeo()` now returns the results in the order `(lat, lon)` (which is the standard order for geometric functions). Users who wish to retain the legacy result order `(lon, lat)` can set setting `h3togeo_lon_lat_result_order = true`. [#74719](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74719) ([Manish Gill](https://github.com/mgill25)).
* A new MongoDB driver is now the default. Users who like to continue using the legacy driver can set server setting `use_legacy_mongodb_integration` to true. [#73359](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73359) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

#### New Feature
* Added an ability to apply non-finished (not materialized by background process) mutations during the execution of `SELECT` queries immediately after submitting. It can be enabled by setting `apply_mutations_on_fly`. [#74877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74877) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Implement `Iceberg` tables partition pruning for time-related transform partition operations in Iceberg. [#72044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72044) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Support subcolumns in MergeTree sorting key and skip indexes. [#72644](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72644) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support reading `HALF_FLOAT` values from `Apache Arrow`/`Parquet`/`ORC` (they are read into `Float32`). This closes [#72960](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72960). Keep in mind that IEEE-754 half float is not the same as `BFloat16`. Closes [#73835](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73835). [#73836](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73836) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `system.trace_log` table will contain two new columns, `symbols` and `lines` containing symbolized stack trace. It allows for easy collection and export of profile information. This is controlled by the server configuration value `symbolize` inside `trace_log` and is enabled by default. [#73896](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73896) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a new function, `generateSerialID`, which can be used to generate auto-incremental numbers in tables. Continuation of [#64310](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64310) by [kazalika](https://github.com/kazalika). This closes [#62485](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/62485). [#73950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73950) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add syntax `query1 PARALLEL WITH query2 PARALLEL WITH query3 ... PARALLEL WITH queryN` for DDL queries. That means subqueries `{query1, query2, ... queryN}` are allowed to run in parallel with each other (and it's preferable). [#73983](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73983) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Added an in-memory cache for deserialized skipping index granules. This should make repeated queries that use skipping indexes faster. The size of the new cache is controlled by server settings `skipping_index_cache_size` and `skipping_index_cache_max_entries`. The original motivation for the cache were vector similarity indexes which became a lot faster now. [#70102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70102) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Now, the embedded Web UI has a progress bar during query runtime. It allows cancelling queries. It displays the total number of records and the extended information about the speed. The table can be rendered incrementally as soon as data arrives. Enable HTTP compression. Rendering of the table became faster. The table header became sticky. It allows selecting cells and navigating them by arrow keys. Fix the issue when the outline of the selected cell makes it smaller. Cells no longer expand on mouse hover but only on selection. The moment to stop rendering the incoming data is decided on the client rather than on the server side. Highlight digit groups for numbers. The overall design was refreshed and became bolder. It checks if the server is reachable and the correctness of credentials and displays the server version and uptime. The cloud icon is contoured in every font, even in Safari. Big integers inside nested data types will be rendered better. It will display inf/nan correctly. It will display data types when the mouse is over a column header. [#74204](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74204) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add the ability to create min-max (skipping) indices by default for columns managed by MergeTree using settings `add_minmax_index_for_numeric_columns` (for numeric columns) and `add_minmax_index_for_string_columns` (for string columns). For now, both settings are disabled, so there is no behavior change yet. [#74266](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74266) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add `script_query_number` and `script_line_number` fields to `system.query_log`, to the ClientInfo in the native protocol, and to server logs. This closes [#67542](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/67542). Credits to [pinsvin00](https://github.com/pinsvin00) for kicking off this feature earlier in [#68133](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68133). [#74477](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74477) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added aggregation function `sequenceMatchEvents` which return timestamps of matched events for longest chain of events in pattern. [#72349](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72349) ([UnamedRus](https://github.com/UnamedRus)).
* Added function `arrayNormalizedGini`. [#72823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72823) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Add minus operator support for `DateTime64`, to allow subtraction between `DateTime64` values, as well as `DateTime`. [#74482](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74482) ([Li Yin](https://github.com/liyinsg)).

#### Experimental Features
* The `BFloat16` data type is production-ready. [#73840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73840) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Optimized function `indexHint`. Now, columns that are only used as arguments of function `indexHint` are not read from the table. [#74314](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74314) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)). If the `indexHint` function is a central piece of your enterprise data architecture, this optimization will save your life.
* More accurate accounting for `max_joined_block_size_rows` setting for `parallel_hash` JOIN algorithm. Helps to avoid increased memory consumption compared to `hash` algorithm. [#74630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74630) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Support predicate push down optimization on the query plan level for the `MergingAggregated` step. It improves performance for some queries with the analyzer. [#74073](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74073) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Splitting of left table blocks by hash was removed from the probe phase of the `parallel_hash` JOIN algorithm. [#73089](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73089) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Optimize RowBinary input format. Closes [#63805](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/63805). [#65059](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65059) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Write parts with level 1 if `optimize_on_insert` is enabled. It allows to use several optimizations of queries with `FINAL` for freshly written parts. [#73132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73132) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Speedup string deserialization by some low-level optimisation. [#65948](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65948) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* When running an equality comparison between records, such as during merges, start to compare rows from most likely unequal columns first. [#63780](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63780) ([UnamedRus](https://github.com/UnamedRus)).
* Improve grace hash join performance by re-ranking the right join table by keys. [#72237](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72237) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Allow `arrayROCAUC` and `arrayAUCPR` to compute partial area of the whole curve, so that its calculation can be parallelized over huge datasets. [#72904](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72904) ([Emmanuel](https://github.com/emmanuelsdias)).
* Avoid spawn too many idle threads. [#72920](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72920) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).
* Don't list blob storage keys if we only have curly brackets expansion in table function. Closes [#73333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73333). [#73518](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73518) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Short circuit optimization for functions executed over Nullable arguments. [#73820](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73820) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Do not apply `maskedExecute` on non-function columns, improve the performance of short circuit execution. [#73965](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73965) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Disable the autodetection of headers in input formats for `Kafka`/`NATS`/`RabbitMQ`/`FileLog` to improve performance. [#74006](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74006) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Execute pipeline with a higher degree of parallelism after aggregation with grouping sets. [#74082](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74082) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Reduce critical section in `MergeTreeReadPool`. [#74202](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74202) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).
* Parallel replicas performance improvement. Packets deserialization on query initiator, for packets not related to parallel replicas protocol, now always happens in pipeline thread. Before, it could happen in a thread responsible for pipeline scheduling, which could make initiator less responsive and delay pipeline execution. [#74398](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74398) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Improve performance of larger multi requests in Keeper. [#74849](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74849) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Use log wrappers by value and don't allocate them in a heap. [#74034](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74034) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
* Reestablish connection to MySQL and Postgres dictionary replicas in the background, so it wouldn't delay requests to corresponding dictionaries. [#71101](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71101) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Parallel replicas used historical information about replica availability to improve replica selection but did not update the replica's error count when the connection was unavailable. This PR updates the replica's error count when unavailable. [#72666](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72666) ([zoomxi](https://github.com/zoomxi)).
* Added a merge tree setting `materialize_skip_indexes_on_merge` which suppresses the creation of skip indexes during merge. This allows users to control explicitly (via `ALTER TABLE [..] MATERIALIZE INDEX [...]`) when skip indexes are created. This can be useful if skip indexes are expensive to build (e.g. vector similarity indexes). [#74401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74401) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Optimize keeper requests in Storage(S3/Azure)Queue. [#74410](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74410) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)). [#74538](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74538) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Use up to `1000` parallel replicas by default. [#74504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74504) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Improve HTTP session reuse when reading from s3 disk ([#72401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72401)). [#74548](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74548) ([Julian Maicher](https://github.com/jmaicher)).

#### Improvement
* Support SETTINGS in a CREATE TABLE query with an implicit ENGINE and support mixing engine and query settings. [#73120](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73120) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Enable `use_hive_partitioning` by default. [#71636](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71636) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Support CAST and ALTER between JSON types with different parameters. [#72303](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72303) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support equal comparison for values of JSON column. [#72991](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72991) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Improve formatting of identifiers with JSON subcolumns to avoid unnecessary back quotes. [#73085](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73085) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Interactive metrics improvements. Fix metrics from parallel replicas not being fully displayed. Display the metrics in order of the most recent update, then lexicographically by name. Do not display stale metrics. [#71631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71631) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Make JSON output format pretty by default. Add new setting `output_format_json_pretty_print` to control it and enable it by default. [#72148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72148) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow `LowCardinality(UUID)` by default. This has proven practical among ClickHouse Cloud customers. [#73826](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73826) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Better message during installation. [#73827](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73827) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Better message about password reset for ClickHouse Cloud. [#73831](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73831) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improve the error message with a File table that cannot perform appends into a file. [#73832](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73832) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Ask when a user accidentally requests to output binary format (such as Native, Parquet, Avro) in the terminal. This closes [#59524](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59524). [#73833](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73833) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Highlight trailing spaces in Pretty and Vertical formats in the terminal for better clarity. This is controlled with the `output_format_pretty_highlight_trailing_spaces` setting. Initial implementation by [Braden Burns](https://github.com/bradenburns) from [#72996](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72996). Closes [#71590](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71590). [#73847](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73847) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `clickhouse-client` and `clickhouse-local` will autodetect compression of stdin when it is redirected from a file. This closes [#70865](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70865). [#73848](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73848) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Cut too long column names in pretty formats by default. This is controlled by the `output_format_pretty_max_column_name_width_cut_to` and `output_format_pretty_max_column_name_width_min_chars_to_cut` settings. This is the continuation of the work of [tanmaydatta](https://github.com/tanmaydatta) in [#66502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/66502). This closes [#65968](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65968). [#73851](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73851) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Make `Pretty` formats prettier: squash blocks if not much time passed since the output of the previous block. This is controlled by new settings `output_format_pretty_squash_consecutive_ms` (50 ms by default) and `output_format_pretty_squash_max_wait_ms` (1000 ms by default). Continuation of [#49537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49537). This closes [#49153](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49153). [#73852](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73852) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a metric on the number of currently merging source parts. This closes [#70809](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70809). [#73868](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73868) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Highlight columns in the `Vertical` format if the output is to a terminal. This can be disabled with the `output_format_pretty_color` setting. [#73898](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73898) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Enhanced the MySQL compatibility to a level that now, `mysqlsh` (a rich MySQL CLI from Oracle) can connect to ClickHouse. This is needed to facilitate testing. [#73912](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73912) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Pretty formats can render multi-line fields inside a table cell, which improves readability. This is enabled by default and can be controlled by the setting `output_format_pretty_multiline_fields`. Continuation of the work by [Volodyachan](https://github.com/Volodyachan) in [#64094](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64094). This closes [#56912](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/56912). [#74032](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74032) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Expose X-ClickHouse HTTP headers to JavaScript in the browser. It makes writing applications more convenient. [#74180](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74180) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `JSONEachRowWithProgress` format will include events with metadata, as well as totals and extremes. It also includes `rows_before_limit_at_least` and `rows_before_aggregation`. The format prints the exception properly if it arrives after partial results. The progress now includes elapsed nanoseconds. One final progress event is emitted at the end. The progress during query runtime will be printed no more frequently than the value of the `interactive_delay` setting. [#74181](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74181) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Hourglass will rotate smoothly in Play UI. [#74182](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74182) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Even if the HTTP response is compressed, send packets as soon as they arrive. This allows the browser to receive progress packets and compressed data. [#74201](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74201) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* If the number of output records is larger than N = `output_format_pretty_max_rows`, instead of displaying only the first N rows, we will cut the output table in the middle, displaying N/2 first rows and N/2 last rows. Continuation of [#64200](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64200). This closes [#59502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59502). [#73929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73929) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow more general join planning algorithm when hash join algorithm is enabled. [#71926](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71926) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Allow to create bloom_filter index on columns with data type `DateTime64`. [#66416](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66416) ([Yutong Xiao](https://github.com/YutSean)).
* When `min_age_to_force_merge_seconds` and `min_age_to_force_merge_on_partition_only` are both enabled, the part merging will ignore the max bytes limit. [#73656](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73656) ([Kai Zhu](https://github.com/nauu)).
* Added HTTP headers to OpenTelemetry span logs table for enhanced traceability. [#70516](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70516) ([jonymohajanGmail](https://github.com/jonymohajanGmail)).
* Support writing `orc` file by custom time zone, not always by the `GMT` time zone. [#70615](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70615) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Respect IO scheduling settings when writing backups across clouds. [#71093](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71093) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Add `metric` column alias `name` to `system.asynchronous_metrics`. [#71164](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71164) ([megao](https://github.com/jetgm)).
* Historically for some reason, the query `ALTER TABLE MOVE PARTITION TO TABLE` checked `SELECT` and `ALTER DELETE` rights instead of dedicated `ALTER_MOVE_PARTITION`. This PR makes use of this access type. For compatibility, this permission is also will be granted implicitly if `SELECT` and `ALTER DELETE` are granted, but this behavior will be removed in future releases. Closes [#16403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16403). [#71632](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71632) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
