### ClickHouse release 23.1

#### Upgrade Notes
* The `SYSTEM RESTART DISK` query becomes a no-op. [#44647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44647) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* The `PREALLOCATE` option for `HASHED`/`SPARSE_HASHED` dictionaries becomes a no-op. [#45388](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45388) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)). It does not give significant advantages anymore.
* Disallow `Gorilla` codec on columns of non-Float32 or non-Float64 type. [#45252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45252) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)). It was pointless and led to inconsistencies. 
* Parallel quorum inserts might work incorrectly with `*MergeTree` tables created with the deprecated syntax. Therefore, parallel quorum inserts support is completely disabled for such tables. It does not affect tables created with a new syntax. [#45430](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45430) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Use `GetObjectAttributes` request instead of `HeadObject` request to get the size of an object in AWS S3. This change fixes handling endpoints without explicit region after updating the AWS SDK, for example. [#45288](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45288) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)). AWS S3 and Minio are tested, but keep in mind that various S3-compatible services (GCS, R2, B2) may have subtle incompatibilities. This change also may require you to adjust the ACL to allow the `GetObjectAttributes` request.
* Forbid paths in timezone names. For example, a timezone name like `/usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Aden` is not allowed; the IANA timezone database name like `Asia/Aden` should be used. [#44225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44225) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### New Feature
* Dictionary source for extracting keys by traversing regular expressions tree. It can be used for User-Agent parsing. [#40878](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40878) ([Vage Ogannisian](https://github.com/nooblose)). [#43858](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43858) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Added parametrized view functionality, now it's possible to specify query parameters for View table engine. resolves [#40907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40907). [#41687](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41687) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add `quantileInterpolatedWeighted`/`quantilesInterpolatedWeighted` functions. [#38252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38252) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Array join support for the `Map` type, like the function "explode" in Spark. [#43239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43239) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Support SQL standard binary and hex string literals. [#43785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43785) ([Mo Xuan](https://github.com/mo-avatar)).
* Allow to format `DateTime` in Joda-Time style. Refer to [the Joda-Time docs](https://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html). [#43818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43818) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Implemented a fractional second formatter (`%f`) for `formatDateTime`. [#44060](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44060) ([ltrk2](https://github.com/ltrk2)). [#44497](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44497) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Added `age` function to calculate difference between two dates or dates with time values expressed as number of full units. Closes [#41115](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41115). [#44421](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44421) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Add `Null` source for dictionaries. Closes [#44240](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44240). [#44502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44502) ([mayamika](https://github.com/mayamika)).
* Allow configuring the S3 storage class with the `s3_storage_class` configuration option. Such as `<s3_storage_class>STANDARD/INTELLIGENT_TIERING</s3_storage_class>` Closes [#44443](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44443). [#44707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44707) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Insert default values in case of missing elements in JSON object while parsing named tuple. Add setting `input_format_json_defaults_for_missing_elements_in_named_tuple` that controls this behaviour. Closes [#45142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45142)#issuecomment-1380153217. [#45231](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45231) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Record server startup time in ProfileEvents (`ServerStartupMilliseconds`). Resolves [#43188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43188). [#45250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45250) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Refactor and Improve streaming engines Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS and add support for all formats, also refactor formats a bit: - Fix producing messages in row-based formats with suffixes/prefixes. Now every message is formatted completely with all delimiters and can be parsed back using input format. - Support block-based formats like Native, Parquet, ORC, etc. Every block is formatted as a separated message. The number of rows in one message depends on the block size, so you can control it via setting `max_block_size`. - Add new engine settings `kafka_max_rows_per_message/rabbitmq_max_rows_per_message/nats_max_rows_per_message`. They control the number of rows formatted in one message in row-based formats. Default value: 1. - Fix high memory consumption in NATS table engine. - Support arbitrary binary data in NATS producer (previously it worked only with strings contained \0 at the end) - Add missing Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS engine settings in documentation. - Refactor producing and consuming in Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS, separate it from WriteBuffers/ReadBuffers semantic. - Refactor output formats: remove callbacks on each row used in Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS (now we don't use callbacks there), allow to use IRowOutputFormat directly, clarify row end and row between delimiters, make it possible to reset output format to start formatting again - Add proper implementation in formatRow function (bonus after formats refactoring). [#42777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42777) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support reading/writing `Nested` tables as `List` of `Struct` in `CapnProto` format. Read/write `Decimal32/64` as `Int32/64`. Closes [#43319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43319). [#43379](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43379) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Added a `message_format_string` column to `system.text_log`. The column contains a pattern that was used to format the message. [#44543](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44543) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)). This allows various analytics over ClickHouse own logs.
* Try to autodetect header with column names (and maybe types) for CSV/TSV/CustomSeparated input formats.
Add settings input_format_tsv/csv/custom_detect_header that enables this behaviour (enabled by default). Closes [#44640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44640). [#44953](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44953) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Add an experimental inverted index as a new secondary index type for efficient text search. [#38667](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38667) ([larryluogit](https://github.com/larryluogit)).
* Add experimental query result cache. [#43797](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43797) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Added extendable and configurable scheduling subsystem for IO requests (not yet integrated with IO code itself). [#41840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41840) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)). This feature does nothing at all, enjoy.
* Added `SYSTEM DROP DATABASE REPLICA` that removes metadata of dead replica of `Replicated` database. Resolves [#41794](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41794). [#42807](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42807) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Do not load inactive parts at startup of `MergeTree` tables. [#42181](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42181) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improved latency of reading from storage `S3` and table function `s3` with large number of small files. Now settings `remote_filesystem_read_method` and `remote_filesystem_read_prefetch` take effect while reading from storage `S3`. [#43726](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43726) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Optimization for reading struct fields in Parquet/ORC files. Only the required fields are loaded. [#44484](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44484) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Two-level aggregation algorithm was mistakenly disabled for queries over HTTP interface. It was enabled back, and it leads to a major performance improvement. [#45450](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45450) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Added mmap support for StorageFile, which should improve the performance of clickhouse-local. [#43927](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43927) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Added sharding support in HashedDictionary to allow parallel load (almost linear scaling based on number of shards). [#40003](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40003) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Speed up query parsing. [#42284](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42284) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Always replace OR chain `expr = x1 OR ... OR expr = xN` to `expr IN (x1, ..., xN)` in case if `expr` is a `LowCardinality` column. Setting `optimize_min_equality_disjunction_chain_length` is ignored in this case. [#42889](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42889) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).
* Slightly improve performance by optimizing the code around ThreadStatus. [#43586](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43586) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Optimize the column-wise ternary logic evaluation by achieving auto-vectorization. In the performance test of this [microbenchmark](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh/ClickHouse/blob/20221123-ternary-logic-opt-example/src/Functions/examples/associative_applier_perf.cpp), we've observed a peak **performance gain** of **21x** on the ICX device (Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 CPU). [#43669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43669) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Avoid acquiring read locks in the `system.tables` table if possible. [#43840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43840) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Optimize ThreadPool. The performance experiments of SSB (Star Schema Benchmark) on the ICX device (Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 CPU, 80 cores, 160 threads) shows that this change could effectively decrease the lock contention for ThreadPoolImpl::mutex by **75%**, increasing the CPU utilization and improving the overall performance by **2.4%**. [#44308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44308) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Now the optimisation for predicting the hash table size is applied only if the cached hash table size is sufficiently large (thresholds were determined empirically and hardcoded). [#44455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44455) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Small performance improvement for asynchronous reading from remote filesystems. [#44868](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44868) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add fast path for: - `col like '%%'`; - `col like '%'`; - `col not like '%'`; - `col not like '%'`; - `match(col, '.*')`. [#45244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45244) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Slightly improve happy path optimisation in filtering (WHERE clause). [#45289](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45289) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Provide monotonicity info for `toUnixTimestamp64*` to enable more algebraic optimizations for index analysis. [#44116](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44116) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Allow to configure temporary data for query processing (spilling to disk) to cooperate with filesystem cache (taking up the space from the cache disk) [#43972](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43972) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)). This mainly improves [ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.cloud/), but can be used for self-managed setups as well, if you know what to do.
* Make `system.replicas` table do parallel fetches of replicas statuses. Closes [#43918](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43918). [#43998](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43998) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Optimize memory consumption during backup to S3: files to S3 now will be copied directly without using `WriteBufferFromS3` (which could use a lot of memory). [#45188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45188) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add a cache for async block ids. This will reduce the requests of zookeeper when we enable async inserts deduplication. [#45106](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45106) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).

#### Improvement

* Use structure from insertion table in generateRandom without arguments. [#45239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45239) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow to implicitly convert floats stored in string fields of JSON to integers in `JSONExtract` functions. E.g. `JSONExtract('{"a": "1000.111"}', 'a', 'UInt64')` -> `1000`, previously it returned 0. [#45432](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45432) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Added fields `supports_parallel_parsing` and `supports_parallel_formatting` to table `system.formats` for better introspection. [#45499](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45499) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improve reading CSV field in CustomSeparated/Template format. Closes [#42352](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42352) Closes [#39620](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39620). [#43332](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43332) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Unify query elapsed time measurements. [#43455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43455) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improve automatic usage of structure from insertion table in table functions file/hdfs/s3 when virtual columns present in select query, it fixes possible error `Block structure mismatch` or `number of columns mismatch`. [#43695](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43695) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add support for signed arguments in function `range`. Fixes [#43333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43333). [#43733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43733) ([sanyu](https://github.com/wineternity)).
* Remove redundant sorting, for example, sorting related ORDER BY clauses in subqueries. Implemented on top of query plan. It does similar optimization as `optimize_duplicate_order_by_and_distinct` regarding `ORDER BY` clauses, but more generic, since it's applied to any redundant sorting steps (not only caused by ORDER BY clause) and applied to subqueries of any depth. Related to [#42648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42648). [#43905](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43905) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Add ability to disable deduplication of files for BACKUP (for backups wiithout deduplication ATTACH can be used instead of full RESTORE), example `BACKUP foo TO S3(...) SETTINGS deduplicate_files=0` (default `deduplicate_files=1`). [#43947](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43947) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Refactor and improve schema inference for text formats. Add new setting `schema_inference_make_columns_nullable` that controls making result types `Nullable` (enabled by default);. [#44019](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44019) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Better support for `PROXYv1` protocol. [#44135](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44135) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Add information about the latest part check by cleanup threads into `system.parts` table. [#44244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44244) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Disable table functions in readonly mode for inserts. [#44290](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44290) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add a setting `simultaneous_parts_removal_limit` to allow to limit the number of parts being processed by one iteration of CleanupThread. [#44461](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44461) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* If user only need virtual columns, we don't need to initialize ReadBufferFromS3. May be helpful to [#44246](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44246). [#44493](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44493) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Prevent duplicate column names hints. Closes [#44130](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44130). [#44519](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44519) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Allow macro substitution in endpoint of disks. Resolve [#40951](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40951). [#44533](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44533) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Improve schema inference when `input_format_json_read_object_as_string` is enabled. [#44546](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44546) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add a user-level setting `database_replicated_allow_replicated_engine_arguments` which allow to ban creation of `ReplicatedMergeTree` tables with arguments in `DatabaseReplicated`. [#44566](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44566) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Prevent users from mistakenly specifying zero (invalid) value for `index_granularity`. This closes [#44536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44536). [#44578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44578) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added possibility to set path to service keytab file in `keytab` parameter in `kerberos` section of config.xml. [#44594](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44594) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* Use already written part of the query for fuzzy search (pass to the `skim` library, which is written in Rust and linked statically to ClickHouse). [#44600](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44600) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Enable `input_format_json_read_objects_as_strings` by default to be able to read nested JSON objects while JSON Object type is experimental. [#44657](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44657) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Improvement for deduplication of async inserts: when users do duplicate async inserts, we should dedup inside the memory before we query keeper. [#44682](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44682) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Input/ouptut `Avro` format will parse bool type as ClickHouse bool type. [#44684](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44684) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support Bool type in Arrow/Parquet/ORC. Closes [#43970](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43970). [#44698](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44698) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Don't greedily parse beyond the quotes when reading UUIDs - it may lead to mistakenly successful parsing of incorrect data. [#44686](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44686) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Infer UInt64 in case of Int64 overflow and fix some transforms in schema inference. [#44696](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44696) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Previously dependency resolving inside `Replicated` database was done in a hacky way, and now it's done right using an explicit graph. [#44697](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44697) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Fix `output_format_pretty_row_numbers` does not preserve the counter across the blocks. Closes [#44815](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44815). [#44832](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44832) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Don't report errors in `system.errors` due to parts being merged concurrently with the background cleanup process. [#44874](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44874) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Optimize and fix metrics for Distributed async INSERT. [#44922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44922) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added settings to disallow concurrent backups and restores resolves [#43891](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43891) Implementation: * Added server level settings to disallow concurrent backups and restores, which are read and set when BackupWorker is created in Context. * Settings are set to true by default. * Before starting backup or restores, added a check to see if any other backups/restores are running. For internal request it checks if its from the self node using backup_uuid. [#45072](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45072) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add `<storage_policy>` config parameter for system logs. [#45320](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45320) ([Stig Bakken](https://github.com/stigsb)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Statically link with the `skim` library (it is written in Rust) for fuzzy search in clickhouse client/local history. [#44239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44239) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* We removed support for shared linking because of Rust. Actually, Rust is only an excuse for this removal, and we wanted to remove it nevertheless. [#44828](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44828) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove the dependency on the `adduser` tool from the packages, because we don't use it. This fixes [#44934](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44934). [#45011](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45011) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `SQLite` library is updated to the latest. It is used for the SQLite database and table integration engines. Also, fixed a false-positive TSan report. This closes [#45027](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45027). [#45031](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45031) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* CRC-32 changes to address the WeakHash collision issue in PowerPC. [#45144](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45144) ([MeenaRenganathan22](https://github.com/MeenaRenganathan22)).
* Update aws-c* submodules [#43020](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43020) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Automatically merge green backport PRs and green approved PRs [#41110](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41110) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Introduce a [website](https://aretestsgreenyet.com/) for the status of ClickHouse CI. [Source](https://github.com/ClickHouse/aretestsgreenyet).

#### Bug Fix

* Replace domain IP types (IPv4, IPv6) with native. [#43221](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43221) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)). It automatically fixes some missing implementations in the code.

* Delay for INSERT can be calculated incorrectly, which can lead to always using `max_delay_to_insert` setting as delay instead of a correct value. Using simple formula `max_delay_to_insert * (parts_over_threshold/max_allowed_parts_over_threshold)` i.e. delay grows proportionally to parts over threshold.
