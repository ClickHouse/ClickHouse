### <a id="226"></a> ClickHouse release 22.6, 2022-06-16

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Remove support for octal number literals in SQL. In previous versions they were parsed as Float64. [#37765](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37765) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Changes how settings using `seconds` as type are parsed to support floating point values (for example: `max_execution_time=0.5`). Infinity or NaN values will throw an exception. [#37187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37187) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Changed format of binary serialization of columns of experimental type `Object`. New format is more convenient to implement by third-party clients. [#37482](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37482) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Turn on setting `output_format_json_named_tuples_as_objects` by default. It allows to serialize named tuples as JSON objects in JSON formats. [#37756](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37756) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* LIKE patterns with trailing escape symbol ('\\') are now disallowed (as mandated by the SQL standard). [#37764](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37764) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* If you run different ClickHouse versions on a cluster with AArch64 CPU or mix AArch64 and amd64 on a cluster, and use distributed queries with GROUP BY multiple keys of fixed-size type that fit in 256 bits but don't fit in 64 bits, and the size of the result is huge, the data will not be fully aggregated in the result of these queries during upgrade. Workaround: upgrade with downtime instead of a rolling upgrade.

#### New Feature
* Add `GROUPING` function. It allows to disambiguate the records in the queries with `ROLLUP`, `CUBE` or `GROUPING SETS`. Closes [#19426](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/19426). [#37163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37163) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* A new codec [FPC](https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/papers/dcc07a.pdf) algorithm for floating point data compression. [#37553](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37553) ([Mikhail Guzov](https://github.com/koloshmet)).
* Add new columnar JSON formats: `JSONColumns`, `JSONCompactColumns`, `JSONColumnsWithMetadata`. Closes [#36338](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36338) Closes [#34509](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34509). [#36975](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36975) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Added open telemetry traces visualizing tool based on d3js. [#37810](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37810) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Support INSERTs into `system.zookeeper` table. Closes [#22130](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22130). [#37596](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37596) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Support non-constant pattern argument for `LIKE`, `ILIKE` and `match` functions. [#37251](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37251) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Executable user defined functions now support parameters. Example: `SELECT test_function(parameters)(arguments)`. Closes [#37578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37578). [#37720](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37720) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Add `merge_reason` column to system.part_log table. [#36912](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36912) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Add support for Maps and Records in Avro format. Add new setting `input_format_avro_null_as_default ` that allow to insert null as default in Avro format.

[#37525](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37525) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add `clickhouse-disks` tool to introspect and operate on virtual filesystems configured for ClickHouse. [#36060](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36060) ([Artyom Yurkov](https://github.com/Varinara)).
* Adds H3 unidirectional edge functions. [#36843](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36843) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add support for calculating [hashids](https://hashids.org/) from unsigned integers. [#37013](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37013) ([Michael Nutt](https://github.com/mnutt)).
* Explicit `SALT` specification is allowed for `CREATE USER <user> IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_hash`. [#37377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37377) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Add two new settings `input_format_csv_skip_first_lines/input_format_tsv_skip_first_lines` to allow skipping specified number of lines in the beginning of the file in CSV/TSV formats. [#37537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37537) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* `showCertificate` function shows current server's SSL certificate. [#37540](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37540) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* HTTP source for Data Dictionaries in Named Collections is supported. [#37581](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37581) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Added a new window function `nonNegativeDerivative(metric_column, timestamp_column[, INTERVAL x SECOND])`. [#37628](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37628) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Implemented changing the comment for `ReplicatedMergeTree` tables. [#37416](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37416) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk)).
* Added `SYSTEM UNFREEZE` query that deletes the whole backup regardless if the corresponding table is deleted or not. [#36424](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36424) ([Vadim Volodin](https://github.com/PolyProgrammist)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Enables `POPULATE` for `WINDOW VIEW`. [#36945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36945) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider)).
* `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY QUERY` support for `WINDOW VIEW`. [#37188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37188) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider)).
* This PR changes the behavior of the `ENGINE` syntax in `WINDOW VIEW`, to make it like in `MATERIALIZED VIEW`. [#37214](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37214) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Added numerous optimizations for ARM NEON [#38093](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38093)([Daniel Kutenin](https://github.com/danlark1)), ([Alexandra Pilipyuk](https://github.com/chalice19)) Note: if you run different ClickHouse versions on a cluster with ARM CPU and use distributed queries with GROUP BY multiple keys of fixed-size type that fit in 256 bits but don't fit in 64 bits, the result of the aggregation query will be wrong during upgrade. Workaround: upgrade with downtime instead of a rolling upgrade.
* Improve performance and memory usage for select of subset of columns for formats Native, Protobuf, CapnProto, JSONEachRow, TSKV, all formats with suffixes WithNames/WithNamesAndTypes. Previously while selecting only subset of columns from files in these formats all columns were read and stored in memory. Now only required columns are read. This PR enables setting `input_format_skip_unknown_fields` by default, because otherwise in case of select of subset of columns exception will be thrown. [#37192](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37192) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Now more filters can be pushed down for join. [#37472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37472) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Load marks for only necessary columns when reading wide parts. [#36879](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36879) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* Improved performance of aggregation in case, when sparse columns (can be enabled by experimental setting `ratio_of_defaults_for_sparse_serialization` in `MergeTree` tables) are used as arguments in aggregate functions. [#37617](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37617) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Optimize function `COALESCE` with two arguments. [#37666](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37666) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Replace `multiIf` to `if` in case when `multiIf` has only one condition, because function `if` is more performant. [#37695](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37695) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improve performance of `dictGetDescendants`, `dictGetChildren` functions, create temporary parent to children hierarchical index per query, not per function call during query. Allow to specify `BIDIRECTIONAL` for `HIERARHICAL` attributes, dictionary will maintain parent to children index in memory, that way functions `dictGetDescendants`, `dictGetChildren` will not create temporary index per query. Closes [#32481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32481). [#37148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37148) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Aggregates state destruction now may be posted on a thread pool. For queries with LIMIT and big state it provides significant speedup, e.g. `select uniq(number) from numbers_mt(1e7) group by number limit 100` became around 2.5x faster. [#37855](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37855) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Improve sort performance by single column. [#37195](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37195) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of single column sorting using sorting queue specializations. [#37990](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37990) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improved performance on array norm and distance functions 2x-4x times. [#37394](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37394) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Improve performance of number comparison functions using dynamic dispatch. [#37399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37399) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of ORDER BY with LIMIT. [#37481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37481) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of `hasAll` function using dynamic dispatch infrastructure. [#37484](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37484) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of `greatCircleAngle`, `greatCircleDistance`, `geoDistance` functions. [#37524](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37524) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of insert into MergeTree if there are multiple columns in ORDER BY. [#35762](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35762) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Fix excessive CPU usage in background when there are a lot of tables. [#38028](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38028) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of `not` function using dynamic dispatch. [#38058](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38058) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Optimized the internal caching of re2 patterns which occur e.g. in LIKE and MATCH functions. [#37544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37544) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Improve filter bitmask generator function all in one with AVX-512 instructions. [#37588](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37588) ([yaqi-zhao](https://github.com/yaqi-zhao)).
* Apply read method `threadpool` for Hive integration engine. This will significantly speed up reading. [#36328](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36328) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* When all the columns to read are partition keys, construct columns by the file's row number without real reading the Hive file. [#37103](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37103) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Support multi disks for caching hive files. [#37279](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37279) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Limiting the maximum cache usage per query can effectively prevent cache pool contamination. [Related Issues](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28961). [#37859](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37859) ([Han Shukai](https://github.com/KinderRiven)).
* Currently clickhouse directly downloads all remote files to the local cache (even if they are only read once), which will frequently cause IO of the local hard disk. In some scenarios, these IOs may not be necessary and may easily cause negative optimization. As shown in the figure below, when we run SSB Q1-Q4, the performance of the cache has caused negative optimization. [#37516](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37516) ([Han Shukai](https://github.com/KinderRiven)).
* Allow to prune the list of files via virtual columns such as `_file` and `_path` when reading from S3. This is for [#37174](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37174) , [#23494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23494). [#37356](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37356) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* In function: CompressedWriteBuffer::nextImpl(), there is an unnecessary write-copy step that would happen frequently during inserting data. Below shows the differentiation with this patch: - Before: 1. Compress "working_buffer" into "compressed_buffer" 2. write-copy into "out" - After: Directly Compress "working_buffer" into "out". [#37242](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37242) ([jasperzhu](https://github.com/jinjunzh)).

#### Improvement
* Support types with non-standard defaults in ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS. Closes [#37360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37360). [#37667](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37667) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Fix stack traces collection on ARM. Closes [#37044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37044). Closes [#15638](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15638). [#37797](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37797) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Client will try every IP address returned by DNS resolution until successful connection. [#37273](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37273) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Allow to use String type instead of Binary in Arrow/Parquet/ORC formats. This PR introduces 3 new settings for it: `output_format_arrow_string_as_string`, `output_format_parquet_string_as_string`, `output_format_orc_string_as_string`. Default value for all settings is `false`. [#37327](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37327) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Apply setting `input_format_max_rows_to_read_for_schema_inference` for all read rows in total from all files in globs. Previously setting `input_format_max_rows_to_read_for_schema_inference` was applied for each file in glob separately and in case of huge number of nulls we could read first `input_format_max_rows_to_read_for_schema_inference` rows from each file and get nothing. Also increase default value for this setting to 25000. [#37332](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37332) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add separate `CLUSTER` grant (and `access_control_improvements.on_cluster_queries_require_cluster_grant` configuration directive, for backward compatibility, default to `false`). [#35767](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35767) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added support for schema inference for `hdfsCluster`. [#35812](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35812) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Implement `least_used` load balancing algorithm for disks inside volume (multi disk configuration). [#36686](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36686) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Modify the HTTP Endpoint to return the full stats under the `X-ClickHouse-Summary` header when `send_progress_in_http_headers=0` (before it would return all zeros). - Modify the HTTP Endpoint to return `X-ClickHouse-Exception-Code` header when progress has been sent before (`send_progress_in_http_headers=1`) - Modify the HTTP Endpoint to return `HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` (408) instead of `HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (500) on `TIMEOUT_EXCEEDED` errors. [#36884](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36884) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Allow a user to inspect grants from granted roles. [#36941](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36941) ([nvartolomei](https://github.com/nvartolomei)).
* Do not calculate an integral numerically but use CDF functions instead. This will speed up execution and will increase the precision. This fixes [#36714](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36714). [#36953](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36953) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Add default implementation for Nothing in functions. Now most of the functions will return column with type Nothing in case one of it's arguments is Nothing. It also solves problem with functions like arrayMap/arrayFilter and similar when they have empty array as an argument. Previously queries like `select arrayMap(x -> 2 * x, []);` failed because function inside lambda cannot work with type `Nothing`, now such queries return empty array with type `Array(Nothing)`. Also add support for arrays of nullable types in functions like arrayFilter/arrayFill. Previously, queries like `select arrayFilter(x -> x % 2, [1, NULL])` failed, now they work (if the result of lambda is NULL, then this value won't be included in the result). Closes [#37000](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37000). [#37048](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37048) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Now if a shard has local replica we create a local plan and a plan to read from all remote replicas. They have shared initiator which coordinates reading. [#37204](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37204) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Do no longer abort server startup if configuration option "mark_cache_size" is not explicitly set. [#37326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37326) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Allows providing `NULL`/`NOT NULL` right after type in column declaration. [#37337](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37337) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* optimize file segment PARTIALLY_DOWNLOADED get read buffer. [#37338](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37338) ([xiedeyantu](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Try to improve short circuit functions processing to fix problems with stress tests. [#37384](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37384) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Closes [#37395](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37395). [#37415](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37415) ([Memo](https://github.com/Joeywzr)).
* Fix extremely rare deadlock during part fetch in zero-copy replication. Fixes [#37423](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37423). [#37424](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37424) ([metahys](https://github.com/metahys)).
* Don't allow to create storage with unknown data format. [#37450](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37450) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Set `global_memory_usage_overcommit_max_wait_microseconds` default value to 5 seconds. Add info about `OvercommitTracker` to OOM exception message. Add `MemoryOvercommitWaitTimeMicroseconds` profile event. [#37460](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37460) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Do not display `-0.0` CPU time in clickhouse-client. It can appear due to rounding errors. This closes [#38003](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38003). This closes [#38038](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38038). [#38064](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38064) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Play UI: Keep controls in place when the page is scrolled horizontally. This makes edits comfortable even if the table is wide and it was scrolled far to the right. The feature proposed by Maksym Tereshchenko from CaspianDB. [#37470](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37470) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Modify query div in play.html to be extendable beyond 20% height. In case of very long queries it is helpful to extend the textarea element, only today, since the div is fixed height, the extended textarea hides the data div underneath. With this fix, extending the textarea element will push the data div down/up such the extended textarea won't hide it. Also, keeps query box width 100% even when the user adjusting the size of the query textarea. [#37488](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37488) ([guyco87](https://github.com/guyco87)).
* Added `ProfileEvents` for introspection of type of written (inserted or merged) parts (`Inserted{Wide/Compact/InMemory}Parts`, `MergedInto{Wide/Compact/InMemory}Parts`. Added column `part_type` to `system.part_log`. Resolves [#37495](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37495). [#37536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37536) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* clickhouse-keeper improvement: move broken logs to a timestamped folder. [#37565](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37565) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Do not write expired columns by TTL after subsequent merges (before only first merge/optimize of the part will not write expired by TTL columns, all other will do). [#37570](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37570) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* More precise result of the `dumpColumnStructure` miscellaneous function in presence of LowCardinality or Sparse columns. In previous versions, these functions were converting the argument to a full column before returning the result. This is needed to provide an answer in [#6935](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6935). [#37633](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37633) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* clickhouse-keeper: store only unique session IDs for watches. [#37641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37641) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix possible "Cannot write to finalized buffer". [#37645](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37645) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add setting `support_batch_delete` for `DiskS3` to disable multiobject delete calls, which Google Cloud Storage doesn't support. [#37659](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37659) ([Fred Wulff](https://github.com/frew)).
* Add an option to disable connection pooling in ODBC bridge. [#37705](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37705) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* Functions `dictGetHierarchy`, `dictIsIn`, `dictGetChildren`, `dictGetDescendants` added support nullable `HIERARCHICAL` attribute in dictionaries. Closes [#35521](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35521). [#37805](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37805) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Expose BoringSSL version related info in the `system.build_options` table. [#37850](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37850) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Now clickhouse-server removes `delete_tmp` directories on server start. Fixes [#26503](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/26503). [#37906](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37906) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Clean up broken detached parts after timeout. Closes [#25195](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/25195). [#37975](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37975) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Now in MergeTree table engines family failed-to-move parts will be removed instantly. [#37994](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37994) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Now if setting `always_fetch_merged_part` is enabled for ReplicatedMergeTree merges will try to find parts on other replicas rarely with smaller load for [Zoo]Keeper. [#37995](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37995) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Add implicit grants with grant option too. For example `GRANT CREATE TABLE ON test.* TO A WITH GRANT OPTION` now allows `A` to execute `GRANT CREATE VIEW ON test.* TO B`. [#38017](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38017) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Use `clang-14` and LLVM infrastructure version 14 for builds. This closes [#34681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34681). [#34754](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34754) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)). Note: `clang-14` has [a bug](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1540) in ThreadSanitizer that makes our CI work worse.
* Allow to drop privileges at startup. This simplifies Docker images. Closes [#36293](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36293). [#36341](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36341) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add docs spellcheck to CI. [#37790](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37790) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).

### <a id="225"></a> ClickHouse release 22.5, 2022-05-19

#### Upgrade Notes

* Now, background merges, mutations and `OPTIMIZE` will not increment `SelectedRows` and `SelectedBytes` metrics. They (still) will increment `MergedRows` and `MergedUncompressedBytes` as it was before. This only affects the metric values, and makes them better. This change does not introduce any incompatibility, but you may wonder about the changes of metrics, so we put in this category. [#37040](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37040) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Updated the BoringSSL module to the official FIPS compliant version. This makes ClickHouse FIPS compliant. [#35914](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35914) ([Meena-Renganathan](https://github.com/Meena-Renganathan)). The ciphers `aes-192-cfb128` and `aes-256-cfb128` were removed, because they are not included in the FIPS certified version of BoringSSL.
* `max_memory_usage` setting is removed from the default user profile in `users.xml`. This enables flexible memory limits for queries instead of the old rigid limit of 10 GB.
* Disable `log_query_threads` setting by default. It controls the logging of statistics about every thread participating in query execution. After supporting asynchronous reads, the total number of distinct thread ids became too large, and logging into the `query_thread_log` has become too heavy. [#37077](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37077) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove function `groupArraySorted` which has a bug. [#36822](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36822) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### New Feature

* Enable memory overcommit by default. [#35921](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35921) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Add support of GROUPING SETS in GROUP BY clause. This implementation supports a parallel processing of grouping sets. [#33631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33631) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Added `system.certificates` table. [#37142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37142) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Adds `h3Line`, `h3Distance` and `h3HexRing` functions. [#37030](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37030) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* New single binary based diagnostics tool (clickhouse-diagnostics). [#36705](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36705) ([Dale McDiarmid](https://github.com/gingerwizard)).
* Add output format `Prometheus` [#36051](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36051). [#36206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36206) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Add `MySQLDump` input format. It reads all data from INSERT queries belonging to one table in dump. If there are more than one table, by default it reads data from the first one. [#36667](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36667) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Show the `total_rows` and `total_bytes` fields in `system.tables` for temporary tables. [#36401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36401). [#36439](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36439) ([xiedeyantu](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Allow to override `parts_to_delay_insert` and `parts_to_throw_insert` with query-level settings. If they are defined, they will override table-level settings. [#36371](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36371) ([Memo](https://github.com/Joeywzr)).

#### Experimental Feature

* Implemented L1, L2, Linf, Cosine distance functions for arrays and L1, L2, Linf norm functions for arrays.
 [#37033](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37033) ([qieqieplus](https://github.com/qieqieplus)). Caveat: the functions will be renamed.
* Improve the `WATCH` query in WindowView: 1. Reduce the latency of providing query results by calling the `fire_condition` signal. 2. Makes the cancel query operation(ctrl-c) faster, by checking `isCancelled()` more frequently. [#37226](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37226) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider)).
* Introspection for remove filesystem cache. [#36802](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36802) ([Han Shukai](https://github.com/KinderRiven)).
* Added new hash function `wyHash64` for SQL. [#36467](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36467) ([olevino](https://github.com/olevino)).
* Improvement for replicated databases: Added `SYSTEM SYNC DATABASE REPLICA` query which allows to sync tables metadata inside Replicated database, because currently synchronisation is asynchronous. [#35944](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35944) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Improvement for remote filesystem cache: Better read from cache. [#37054](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37054) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)). Improve `SYSTEM DROP FILESYSTEM CACHE` query: `<path>` option and `FORCE` option. [#36639](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36639) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Improvement for semistructured data: Allow to cast columns of type `Object(...)` to `Object(Nullable(...))`. [#36564](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36564) ([awakeljw](https://github.com/awakeljw)).
* Improvement for parallel replicas: We create a local interpreter if we want to execute query on localhost replica. But for when executing query on multiple replicas we rely on the fact that a connection exists so replicas can talk to coordinator. It is now improved and localhost replica can talk to coordinator directly in the same process. [#36281](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36281) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

#### Performance Improvement

* Improve performance of `avg`, `sum` aggregate functions if used without GROUP BY expression. [#37257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37257) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of unary arithmetic functions (`bitCount`, `bitNot`, `abs`, `intExp2`, `intExp10`, `negate`, `roundAge`, `roundDuration`, `roundToExp2`, `sign`) using dynamic dispatch. [#37289](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37289) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of ORDER BY, MergeJoin, insertion into MergeTree using JIT compilation of sort columns comparator. [#34469](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34469) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Change structure of `system.asynchronous_metric_log`. It will take about 10 times less space. This closes [#36357](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36357). The field `event_time_microseconds` was removed, because it is useless. [#36360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36360) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Load marks for only necessary columns when reading wide parts. [#36879](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36879) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* Improves performance of file descriptor cache by narrowing mutex scopes. [#36682](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36682) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* Improve performance of reading from storage `File` and table functions `file` in case when path has globs and matched directory contains large number of files. [#36647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36647) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Apply parallel parsing for input format `HiveText`, which can speed up HiveText parsing by 2x when reading local file. [#36650](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36650) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* The default `HashJoin` is not thread safe for inserting right table's rows and run it in a single thread. When the right table is large, the join process is too slow with low cpu utilization. [#36415](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36415) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Allow to rewrite `select countDistinct(a) from t` to `select count(1) from (select a from t groupBy a)`. [#35993](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35993) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Transform OR LIKE chain to multiMatchAny. Will enable once we have more confidence it works. [#34932](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34932) ([Daniel Kutenin](https://github.com/danlark1)).
* Improve performance of some functions with inlining. [#34544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34544) ([Daniel Kutenin](https://github.com/danlark1)).
* Add a branch to avoid unnecessary memcpy in readBig. It improves performance somewhat. [#36095](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36095) ([jasperzhu](https://github.com/jinjunzh)).
* Implement partial GROUP BY key for optimize_aggregation_in_order. [#35111](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35111) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### Improvement
 
* Show names of erroneous files in case of parsing errors while executing table functions `file`, `s3` and `url`. [#36314](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36314) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Allowed to increase the number of threads for executing background operations (merges, mutations, moves and fetches) at runtime if they are specified at top level config. [#36425](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36425) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Now date time conversion functions that generates time before 1970-01-01 00:00:00 with partial hours/minutes timezones will be saturated to zero instead of overflow. This is the continuation of https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/29953 which addresses https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/29953#discussion_r800550280 . Mark as improvement because it's implementation defined behavior (and very rare case) and we are allowed to break it. [#36656](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36656) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Add a warning if someone running clickhouse-server with log level "test". The log level "test" was added recently and cannot be used in production due to inevitable, unavoidable, fatal and life-threatening performance degradation.

* Improve schema inference for JSON objects. [#36207](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36207) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Refactor code around schema inference with globs. Try next file from glob only if it makes sense (previously we tried next file in case of any error). Also it fixes [#36317](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36317). [#36205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36205) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* If the required amount of memory is available before the selected query stopped, all waiting queries continue execution. Now we don't stop any query if memory is freed before the moment when the selected query knows about the cancellation. [#35637](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35637) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Nullables detection in protobuf. In proto3, default values are not sent on the wire. This makes it non-trivial to distinguish between null and default values for Nullable columns. A standard way to deal with this problem is to use Google wrappers to nest the target value within an inner message (see https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/wrappers.proto). In this case, a missing field is interpreted as null value, a field with missing value if interpreted as default value, and a field with regular value is interpreted as regular value. However, ClickHouse interprets Google wrappers as nested columns. We propose to introduce special behaviour to detect Google wrappers and interpret them like in the description above. For example, to serialize values for a Nullable column `test`, we would use `google.protobuf.StringValue test` in our .proto schema. Note that these types are so called "well-known types" in Protobuf, implemented in the library itself. [#35149](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35149) ([Jakub Kuklis](https://github.com/jkuklis)).
* Added support for specifying `content_type` in predefined and static HTTP handler config. [#34916](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34916) ([Roman Nikonov](https://github.com/nic11)).
* Warn properly if use clickhouse-client --file without preceeding --external. Close [#34747](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34747). [#34765](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34765) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).

* Improve JSON report of clickhouse-benchmark. [#36473](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36473) ([Tian Xinhui](https://github.com/xinhuitian)).
* Server might refuse to start if it cannot resolve hostname of external ClickHouse dictionary. It's fixed. Fixes [#36451](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36451). [#36463](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36463) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

* Fix substring function range error length when `offset` and `length` is negative constant and `s` is not constant. [#33861](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33861) ([RogerYK](https://github.com/RogerYK)).


### <a id="224"></a> ClickHouse release 22.4, 2022-04-19

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* Do not allow SETTINGS after FORMAT for INSERT queries (there is compatibility setting `allow_settings_after_format_in_insert` to accept such queries, but it is turned OFF by default). [#35883](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35883) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Function `yandexConsistentHash` (consistent hashing algorithm by Konstantin "kostik" Oblakov) is renamed to `kostikConsistentHash`. The old name is left as an alias for compatibility. Although this change is backward compatible, we may remove the alias in subsequent releases, that's why it's recommended to update the usages of this function in your apps. [#35553](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35553) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### New Feature

* Added INTERPOLATE extension to the ORDER BY ... WITH FILL. Closes [#34903](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34903). [#35349](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35349) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Profiling on Processors level (under `log_processors_profiles` setting, ClickHouse will write time that processor spent during execution/waiting for data to `system.processors_profile_log` table). [#34355](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34355) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added functions makeDate(year, month, day), makeDate32(year, month, day). [#35628](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35628) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)). Implementation of makeDateTime() and makeDateTIme64(). [#35934](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35934) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Support new type of quota `WRITTEN BYTES` to limit amount of written bytes during insert queries. [#35736](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35736) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Added function `flattenTuple`. It receives nested named `Tuple` as an argument and returns a flatten `Tuple` which elements are the paths from the original `Tuple`. E.g.: `Tuple(a Int, Tuple(b Int, c Int)) -> Tuple(a Int, b Int, c Int)`. `flattenTuple` can be used to select all paths from type `Object` as separate columns. [#35690](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35690) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Added functions `arrayFirstOrNull`, `arrayLastOrNull`. Closes [#35238](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35238). [#35414](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35414) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Added functions `minSampleSizeContinous` and `minSampleSizeConversion`. Author [achimbab](https://github.com/achimbab). [#35360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35360) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* New functions minSampleSizeContinous and minSampleSizeConversion. [#34354](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34354) ([achimbab](https://github.com/achimbab)).
* Introduce format `ProtobufList` (all records as repeated messages in out Protobuf). Closes [#16436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16436). [#35152](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35152) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Add `h3PointDistM`, `h3PointDistKm`, `h3PointDistRads`, `h3GetRes0Indexes`, `h3GetPentagonIndexes` functions. [#34568](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34568) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add `toLastDayOfMonth` function which rounds up a date or date with time to the last day of the month. [#33501](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33501). [#34394](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34394) ([Habibullah Oladepo](https://github.com/holadepo)).
* Added load balancing setting for \[Zoo\]Keeper client. Closes [#29617](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/29617). [#30325](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/30325) ([小路](https://github.com/nicelulu)).
* Add a new kind of row policies named `simple`. Before this PR we had two kinds or row policies: `permissive` and `restrictive`. A `simple` row policy adds a new filter on a table without any side-effects like it was for permissive and restrictive policies. [#35345](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35345) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Added an ability to specify cluster secret in replicated database. [#35333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35333) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Added sanity checks on server startup (available memory and disk space, max thread count, etc). [#34566](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34566) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* INTERVAL improvement - can be used with `[MILLI|MICRO|NANO]SECOND`. Added `toStartOf[Milli|Micro|Nano]second()` functions. Added `[add|subtract][Milli|Micro|Nano]seconds()`. [#34353](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34353) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).

#### Experimental Feature

* Added support for transactions for simple `MergeTree` tables. This feature is highly experimental and not recommended for production. Part of [#22086](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22086). [#24258](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/24258) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Support schema inference for type `Object` in format `JSONEachRow`. Allow to convert columns of type `Map` to columns of type `Object`. [#35629](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35629) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Allow to write remote FS cache on all write operations. Add `system.remote_filesystem_cache` table. Add `drop remote filesystem cache` query. Add introspection for s3 metadata with `system.remote_data_paths` table. Closes [#34021](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34021). Add cache option for merges by adding mode `read_from_filesystem_cache_if_exists_otherwise_bypass_cache` (turned on by default for merges and can also be turned on by query setting with the same name). Rename cache related settings (`remote_fs_enable_cache -> enable_filesystem_cache`, etc). [#35475](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35475) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* An option to store parts metadata in RocksDB. Speed up parts loading process of MergeTree to accelerate starting up of clickhouse-server. With this improvement, clickhouse-server was able to decrease starting up time from 75 minutes to 20 seconds, with 700k mergetree parts. [#32928](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32928) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).

#### Performance Improvement

* A new query plan optimization. Evaluate functions after `ORDER BY` when possible. As an example, for a query `SELECT sipHash64(number) FROM numbers(1e8) ORDER BY number LIMIT 5`, function `sipHash64` would be evaluated after `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, which gives ~20x speed up. [#35623](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35623) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Sizes of hash tables used during aggregation now collected and used in later queries to avoid hash tables resizes. [#33439](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33439) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Improvement for hasAll function using SIMD instructions (SSE and AVX2). [#27653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/27653) ([youennL-cs](https://github.com/youennL-cs)). [#35723](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35723) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Multiple changes to improve ASOF JOIN performance (1.2 - 1.6x as fast). It also adds support to use big integers. [#34733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34733) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improve performance of ASOF JOIN if key is native integer. [#35525](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35525) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Parallelization of multipart upload into S3 storage. [#35343](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35343) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* URL storage engine now downloads multiple chunks in parallel if the endpoint supports HTTP Range. Two additional settings were added, `max_download_threads` and `max_download_buffer_size`, which control maximum number of threads a single query can use to download the file and the maximum number of bytes each thread can process. [#35150](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35150) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Use multiple threads to download objects from S3. Downloading is controllable using `max_download_threads` and `max_download_buffer_size` settings. [#35571](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35571) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Narrow mutex scope when interacting with HDFS. Related to [#35292](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35292). [#35646](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35646) ([shuchaome](https://github.com/shuchaome)).
* Require mutations for per-table TTL only when it had been changed. [#35953](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35953) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### Improvement

* Multiple improvements for schema inference. Use some tweaks and heuristics to determine numbers, strings, arrays, tuples and maps in CSV, TSV and TSVRaw data formats. Add setting `input_format_csv_use_best_effort_in_schema_inference` for CSV format that enables/disables using these heuristics, if it's disabled, we treat everything as string. Add similar setting `input_format_tsv_use_best_effort_in_schema_inference` for TSV/TSVRaw format. These settings are enabled by default. - Add Maps support for schema inference in Values format. - Fix possible segfault in schema inference in Values format. - Allow to skip columns with unsupported types in Arrow/ORC/Parquet formats. Add corresponding settings for it: `input_format_{parquet|orc|arrow}_skip_columns_with_unsupported_types_in_schema_inference`. These settings are disabled by default. - Allow to convert a column with type Null to a Nullable column with all NULL values in Arrow/Parquet formats. - Allow to specify column names in schema inference via setting `column_names_for_schema_inference` for formats that don't contain column names (like CSV, TSV, JSONCompactEachRow, etc) - Fix schema inference in ORC/Arrow/Parquet formats in terms of working with Nullable columns. Previously all inferred types were not Nullable and it blocked reading Nullable columns from data, now it's fixed and all inferred types are always Nullable (because we cannot understand that column is Nullable or not by reading the schema). - Fix schema inference in Template format with CSV escaping rules. [#35582](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35582) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add parallel parsing and schema inference for format `JSONAsObject`. [#35592](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35592) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

* Added support for schema inference for `hdfsCluster`. [#35602](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35602) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Add new setting `input_format_json_read_bools_as_numbers` that allows to infer and parse bools as numbers in JSON input formats. It's enabled by default. Suggested by @alexey-milovidov. [#35735](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35735) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Improve columns ordering in schema inference for formats TSKV and JSONEachRow, closes [#35640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35640). Don't stop schema inference when reading empty row in schema inference for formats TSKV and JSONEachRow. [#35724](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35724) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add settings `input_format_orc_case_insensitive_column_matching`, `input_format_arrow_case_insensitive_column_matching`, and `input_format_parquet_case_insensitive_column_matching` which allows ClickHouse to use case insensitive matching of columns while reading data from ORC, Arrow or Parquet files. [#35459](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35459) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Added `is_secure` column to `system.query_log` which denotes if the client is using a secure connection over TCP or HTTP. [#35705](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35705) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Now `kafka_num_consumers` can be bigger than amount of physical cores in case of low resource machine (less than 16 cores). [#35926](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35926) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Add some basic metrics to monitor engine=Kafka tables. [#35916](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35916) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).

* Now some `ALTER MODIFY COLUMN` queries for `Arrays` and `Nullable` types can be done at metadata level without mutations. For example, alter from `Array(Enum8('Option1'=1))` to `Array(Enum8('Option1'=1, 'Option2'=2))`. [#35882](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35882) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

* It was possible to get stack overflow in distributed queries if one of the settings `async_socket_for_remote` and `use_hedged_requests` is enabled while parsing very deeply nested data type (at least in debug build). Closes [#35509](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35509). [#35524](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35524) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Proper support of setting `max_rows_to_read` in case of reading in order of sorting key and specified limit. Previously the exception `Limit for rows or bytes to read exceeded` could be thrown even if query actually requires to read less amount of rows. [#33230](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33230) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

## <a id="223"></a> ClickHouse release v22.3-lts, 2022-03-17

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* Make `arrayCompact` function behave as other higher-order functions: perform compaction not of lambda function results but on the original array. If you're using nontrivial lambda functions in arrayCompact you may restore old behaviour by wrapping `arrayCompact` arguments into `arrayMap`. Closes [#34010](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34010) [#18535](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/18535) [#14778](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14778). [#34795](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34795) ([Alexandre Snarskii](https://github.com/snar)).
* Change implementation specific behavior on overflow of function `toDatetime`. It will be saturated to the nearest min/max supported instant of datetime instead of wraparound. This change is highlighted as "backward incompatible" because someone may unintentionally rely on the old behavior. [#32898](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32898) ([HaiBo Li](https://github.com/marising)).
* Make function `cast(value, 'IPv4')`, `cast(value, 'IPv6')` behave same as `toIPv4`, `toIPv6` functions. Changed behavior of incorrect IP address passed into functions `toIPv4`,` toIPv6`,  now if invalid IP address passes into this functions exception will be raised, before this function return default value. Added functions `IPv4StringToNumOrDefault`, `IPv4StringToNumOrNull`, `IPv6StringToNumOrDefault`, `IPv6StringOrNull` `toIPv4OrDefault`, `toIPv4OrNull`, `toIPv6OrDefault`, `toIPv6OrNull`. Functions `IPv4StringToNumOrDefault `, `toIPv4OrDefault `, `toIPv6OrDefault ` should be used if previous logic relied on `IPv4StringToNum`, `toIPv4`, `toIPv6` returning default value for invalid address. Added setting `cast_ipv4_ipv6_default_on_conversion_error`, if this setting enabled, then IP address conversion functions will behave as before. Closes [#22825](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22825). Closes [#5799](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5799). Closes [#35156](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35156). [#35240](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35240) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).

#### New Feature

* Support for caching data locally for remote filesystems. It can be enabled for `s3` disks. Closes [#28961](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28961). [#33717](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33717) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)). In the meantime, we enabled the test suite on s3 filesystem and no more known issues exist, so it is started to be production ready.
* Add new table function `hive`. It can be used as follows `hive('<hive metastore url>', '<hive database>', '<hive table name>', '<columns definition>', '<partition columns>')` for example `SELECT * FROM hive('thrift://hivetest:9083', 'test', 'demo', 'id Nullable(String), score Nullable(Int32), day Nullable(String)', 'day')`. [#34946](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34946) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Support authentication of users connected via SSL by their X.509 certificate. [#31484](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31484) ([eungenue](https://github.com/eungenue)).
* Support schema inference for inserting into table functions `file`/`hdfs`/`s3`/`url`. [#34732](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34732) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Now you can read `system.zookeeper` table without restrictions on path or using `like` expression. This reads can generate quite heavy load for zookeeper so to enable this ability you have to enable setting `allow_unrestricted_reads_from_keeper`. [#34609](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34609) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Display CPU and memory metrics in clickhouse-local. Close [#34545](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34545). [#34605](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34605) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Implement `startsWith` and `endsWith` function for arrays, closes [#33982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33982). [#34368](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34368) ([usurai](https://github.com/usurai)).
* Add three functions for Map data type: 1. `mapReplace(map1, map2)` - replaces values for keys in map1 with the values of the corresponding keys in map2; adds keys from map2 that don't exist in map1. 2. `mapFilter` 3. `mapMap`. mapFilter and mapMap are higher order functions, accepting two arguments, the first argument is a lambda function with k, v pair as arguments, the second argument is a column of type Map. [#33698](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33698) ([hexiaoting](https://github.com/hexiaoting)).
* Allow getting default user and password for clickhouse-client from the `CLICKHOUSE_USER` and `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` environment variables. Close [#34538](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34538). [#34947](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34947) ([DR](https://github.com/freedomDR)).

#### Experimental Feature

* New data type `Object(<schema_format>)`, which supports storing of semi-structured data (for now JSON only). Data is written to such types as string. Then all paths are extracted according to format of semi-structured data and written as separate columns in most optimal types, that can store all their values. Those columns can be queried by names that match paths in source data. E.g `data.key1.key2` or with cast operator `data.key1.key2::Int64`.
* Add `database_replicated_allow_only_replicated_engine` setting. When enabled, it only allowed to only create `Replicated` tables or tables with stateless engines in `Replicated` databases. [#35214](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35214) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)). Note that `Replicated` database is still an experimental feature.

#### Performance Improvement

* Improve performance of insertion into `MergeTree` tables by optimizing sorting. Up to 2x improvement is observed on realistic benchmarks. [#34750](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34750) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Columns pruning when reading Parquet, ORC and Arrow files from URL and S3. Closes [#34163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34163). [#34849](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34849) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Columns pruning when reading Parquet, ORC and Arrow files from Hive. [#34954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34954) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* A bunch of performance optimizations from a performance superhero. Improve performance of processing queries with large `IN` section. Improve performance of `direct` dictionary if its source is `ClickHouse`. Improve performance of `detectCharset `, `detectLanguageUnknown ` functions. [#34888](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34888) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of `any` aggregate function by using more batching. [#34760](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34760) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Multiple improvements for performance of `clickhouse-keeper`: less locking [#35010](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35010) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)), lower memory usage by streaming reading and writing of snapshot instead of full copy. [#34584](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34584) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)), optimizing compaction of log store in the RAFT implementation. [#34534](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34534) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)), versioning of the internal data structure [#34486](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34486) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).

#### Improvement

* Allow asynchronous inserts to table functions. Fixes [#34864](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34864). [#34866](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34866) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Implicit type casting of the key argument for functions `dictGetHierarchy`, `dictIsIn`, `dictGetChildren`, `dictGetDescendants`. Closes [#34970](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34970). [#35027](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35027) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* `EXPLAIN AST` query can output AST in form of a graph in Graphviz format: `EXPLAIN AST graph = 1 SELECT * FROM system.parts`. [#35173](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35173) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* When large files were written with `s3` table function or table engine, the content type on the files was mistakenly set to `application/xml` due to a bug in the AWS SDK. This closes [#33964](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33964). [#34433](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34433) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Change restrictive row policies a bit to make them an easier alternative to permissive policies in easy cases. If for a particular table only restrictive policies exist (without permissive policies) users will be able to see some rows. Also `SHOW CREATE ROW POLICY` will always show `AS permissive` or `AS restrictive` in row policy's definition. [#34596](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34596) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Improve schema inference with globs in File/S3/HDFS/URL engines. Try to use the next path for schema inference in case of error. [#34465](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34465) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Play UI now correctly detects the preferred light/dark theme from the OS. [#35068](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35068) ([peledni](https://github.com/peledni)).
* Added `date_time_input_format = 'best_effort_us'`. Closes [#34799](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34799). [#34982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34982) ([WenYao](https://github.com/Cai-Yao)).
* A new settings called `allow_plaintext_password` and `allow_no_password` are added in server configuration which turn on/off authentication types that can be potentially insecure in some environments. They are allowed by default. [#34738](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34738) ([Heena Bansal](https://github.com/HeenaBansal2009)).
* Support for `DateTime64` data type in `Arrow` format, closes [#8280](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8280) and closes [#28574](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28574). [#34561](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34561) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Reload `remote_url_allow_hosts` (filtering of outgoing connections) on config update. [#35294](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35294) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Support `--testmode` parameter for `clickhouse-local`. This parameter enables interpretation of test hints that we use in functional tests. [#35264](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35264) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add `distributed_depth` to query log. It is like a more detailed variant of `is_initial_query` [#35207](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35207) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Respect `remote_url_allow_hosts` for `MySQL` and `PostgreSQL` table functions. [#35191](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35191) ([Heena Bansal](https://github.com/HeenaBansal2009)).
* Added `disk_name` field to `system.part_log`. [#35178](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35178) ([Artyom Yurkov](https://github.com/Varinara)).
* Do not retry non-rertiable errors when querying remote URLs. Closes [#35161](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35161). [#35172](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35172) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Support distributed INSERT SELECT queries (the setting `parallel_distributed_insert_select`) table function `view()`. [#35132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35132) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* More precise memory tracking during `INSERT` into `Buffer` with `AggregateFunction`. [#35072](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35072) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Avoid division by zero in Query Profiler if Linux kernel has a bug. Closes [#34787](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34787). [#35032](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35032) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add more sanity checks for keeper configuration: now mixing of localhost and non-local servers is not allowed, also add checks for same value of internal raft port and keeper client port. [#35004](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35004) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Currently, if the user changes the settings of the system tables there will be tons of logs and ClickHouse will rename the tables every minute. This fixes [#34929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34929). [#34949](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34949) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Use connection pool for Hive metastore client. [#34940](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34940) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Ignore per-column `TTL` in `CREATE TABLE AS` if new table engine does not support it (i.e. if the engine is not of `MergeTree` family). [#34938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34938) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Allow `LowCardinality` strings for `ngrambf_v1`/`tokenbf_v1` indexes. Closes [#21865](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21865). [#34911](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34911) ([Lars Hiller Eidnes](https://github.com/larspars)).
* Allow opening empty sqlite db if the file doesn't exist. Closes [#33367](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33367). [#34907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34907) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Implement memory statistics for FreeBSD - this is required for `max_server_memory_usage` to work correctly. [#34902](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34902) ([Alexandre Snarskii](https://github.com/snar)).
* In previous versions the progress bar in clickhouse-client can jump forward near 50% for no reason. This closes [#34324](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34324). [#34801](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34801) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Now `ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN columnX` queries for `MergeTree` table engines will work instantly when `columnX` is an `ALIAS` column. Fixes [#34660](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34660). [#34786](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34786) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

* Do not reset logging that configured via `--log-file`/`--errorlog-file` command line options in case of empty configuration in the config file. [#34718](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34718) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Extract schema only once on table creation and prevent reading from local files/external sources to extract schema on each server startup. [#34684](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34684) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow specifying argument names for executable UDFs. This is necessary for formats where argument name is part of serialization, like `Native`, `JSONEachRow`. Closes [#34604](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34604). [#34653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34653) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* `MaterializedMySQL` (experimental feature) now supports `materialized_mysql_tables_list` (a comma-separated list of MySQL database tables, which will be replicated by the MaterializedMySQL database engine. Default value: empty list — means all the tables will be replicated), mentioned at [#32977](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32977). [#34487](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34487) ([zzsmdfj](https://github.com/zzsmdfj)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement

* Package repository is migrated to JFrog Artifactory (**Mikhail f. Shiryaev**).
* Randomize some settings in functional tests, so more possible combinations of settings will be tested. This is yet another fuzzing method to ensure better test coverage. This closes [#32268](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32268). [#34092](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34092) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Smaller "fat-free" `clickhouse-keeper` build. [#35031](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35031) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Use @robot-clickhouse as an author and committer for PRs like https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34685. [#34793](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34793) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Limit DWARF version for debug info by 4 max, because our internal stack symbolizer cannot parse DWARF version 5. This makes sense if you compile ClickHouse with clang-15. [#34777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34777) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove `clickhouse-test` debian package as unneeded complication. CI use tests from repository and standalone testing via deb package is no longer supported. [#34606](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34606) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehaviour in official stable or prestable release)

### <a id="222"></a> ClickHouse release v22.2, 2022-02-17

#### Upgrade Notes

* Applying data skipping indexes for queries with FINAL may produce incorrect result. In this release we disabled data skipping indexes by default for queries with FINAL (a new setting `use_skip_indexes_if_final` is introduced and disabled by default). [#34243](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34243) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### New Feature

* Projections are production ready. Set `allow_experimental_projection_optimization` by default and deprecate this setting. [#34456](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34456) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* An option to create a new files on insert for `File`/`S3`/`HDFS` engines. Allow to overwrite a file in `HDFS`. Throw an exception in attempt to overwrite a file in `S3` by default. Throw an exception in attempt to append data to file in formats that have a suffix (and thus don't support appends, like `Parquet`, `ORC`). Closes [#31640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31640) Closes [#31622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31622) Closes [#23862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23862) Closes [#15022](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15022) Closes [#16674](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16674). [#33302](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33302) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add a setting that allows a user to provide own deduplication semantic in `MergeTree`/`ReplicatedMergeTree` If provided, it's used instead of data digest to generate block ID. So, for example, by providing a unique value for the setting in each INSERT statement, the user can avoid the same inserted data being deduplicated. This closes: [#7461](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7461). [#32304](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32304) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Add support of `DEFAULT` keyword for INSERT statements. Closes [#6331](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6331). [#33141](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33141) ([Andrii Buriachevskyi](https://github.com/1over)).
* `EPHEMERAL` column specifier is added to `CREATE TABLE` query. Closes [#9436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9436). [#34424](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34424) ([yakov-olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Support `IF EXISTS` clause for `TTL expr TO [DISK|VOLUME] [IF EXISTS] 'xxx'` feature. Parts will be moved to disk or volume only if it exists on replica, so `MOVE TTL` rules will be able to behave differently on replicas according to the existing storage policies. Resolves [#34455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34455). [#34504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34504) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Allow set default table engine and to create tables without specifying ENGINE. [#34187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34187) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).

* Detect format in `clickhouse-local` by file name even in the case when it is passed to stdin. [#33829](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33829) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add schema inference for `values` table function. Closes [#33811](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33811). [#34017](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34017) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Dynamic reload of server TLS certificates on config reload. Closes [#15764](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15764). [#15765](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15765) ([johnskopis](https://github.com/johnskopis)). [#31257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31257) ([Filatenkov Artur](https://github.com/FArthur-cmd)).
* Now ReplicatedMergeTree can recover data when some of its disks are broken. [#13544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13544) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Fault-tolerant connections in clickhouse-client: `clickhouse-client ... --host host1 --host host2 --port port2 --host host3 --port port --host host4`. [#34490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34490) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)). [#33824](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33824) ([Filippov Denis](https://github.com/DF5HSE)).
* Add `DEGREES` and `RADIANS` functions for MySQL compatibility. [#33769](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33769) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add `h3ToCenterChild` function. [#33313](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33313) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)). Add new h3 miscellaneous functions: `edgeLengthKm`,`exactEdgeLengthKm`,`exactEdgeLengthM`,`exactEdgeLengthRads`,`numHexagons`. [#33621](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33621) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add function `bitSlice` to extract bit subsequences from String/FixedString. [#33360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33360) ([RogerYK](https://github.com/RogerYK)).
* Implemented `meanZTest` aggregate function. [#33354](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33354) ([achimbab](https://github.com/achimbab)).
* Add confidence intervals to T-tests aggregate functions. [#33260](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33260) ([achimbab](https://github.com/achimbab)).
* Add function `addressToLineWithInlines`. Close [#26211](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/26211). [#33467](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33467) ([SuperDJY](https://github.com/cmsxbc)).
* Added `#!` and `# ` as a recognised start of a single line comment. Closes [#34138](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34138). [#34230](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34230) ([Aaron Katz](https://github.com/aaronstephenkatz)).

#### Experimental Feature

* Functions for text classification: language and charset detection. See [#23271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23271). [#33314](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33314) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Add memory overcommit to `MemoryTracker`. Added `guaranteed` settings for memory limits which represent soft memory limits. In case when hard memory limit is reached, `MemoryTracker` tries to cancel the most overcommited query. New setting `memory_usage_overcommit_max_wait_microseconds` specifies how long queries may wait another query to stop. Closes [#28375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28375). [#31182](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31182) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).

[#33429](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33429) ([zzsmdfj](https://github.com/zzsmdfj)).
* Fix various issues when projection is enabled by default. Each issue is described in separate commit. This is for [#33678](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33678) . This fixes [#34273](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34273). [#34305](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34305) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

#### Performance Improvement

* Support `optimize_read_in_order` if prefix of sorting key is already sorted. E.g. if we have sorting key `ORDER BY (a, b)` in table and query with `WHERE a = const ORDER BY b` clauses, now it will be applied reading in order of sorting key instead of full sort. [#32748](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32748) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improve performance of partitioned insert into table functions `URL`, `S3`, `File`, `HDFS`. Closes [#34348](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34348). [#34510](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34510) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).

* `_file` and `_path` virtual columns (in file-like table engines) are made `LowCardinality` - it will make queries for multiple files faster. Closes [#34300](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34300). [#34317](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34317) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Speed up loading of data parts. It was not parallelized before: the setting `part_loading_threads` did not have effect. See [#4699](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4699).

### <a id="221"></a> ClickHouse release v22.1, 2022-01-18

#### Upgrade Notes

* The functions `left` and `right` were previously implemented in parser and now full-featured. Distributed queries with `left` or `right` functions without aliases may throw exception if cluster contains different versions of clickhouse-server. If you are upgrading your cluster and encounter this error, you should finish upgrading your cluster to ensure all nodes have the same version. Also you can add aliases (`AS something`) to the columns in your queries to avoid this issue. [#33407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33407) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Resource usage by scalar subqueries is fully accounted since this version. With this change, rows read in scalar subqueries are now reported in the query_log. If the scalar subquery is cached (repeated or called for several rows) the rows read are only counted once. This change allows KILLing queries and reporting progress while they are executing scalar subqueries. [#32271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32271) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

#### New Feature

* Implement data schema inference for input formats. Allow to skip structure (or write just `auto`) in table functions `file`, `url`, `s3`, `hdfs` and in parameters of `clickhouse-local` . Allow to skip structure in create query for table engines `File`, `HDFS`, `S3`, `URL`, `Merge`, `Buffer`, `Distributed` and `ReplicatedMergeTree` (if we add new replicas). [#32455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32455) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Detect format by file extension in `file`/`hdfs`/`s3`/`url` table functions and `HDFS`/`S3`/`URL` table engines and also for `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` and `INSERT FROM INFILE` [#33565](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33565) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)). Close [#30918](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/30918). [#33443](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33443) ([OnePiece](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* A tool for collecting diagnostics data if you need support. [#33175](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33175) ([Alexander Burmak](https://github.com/Alex-Burmak)).
* Automatic cluster discovery via Zoo/Keeper. It allows to add replicas to the cluster without changing configuration on every server. [#31442](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31442) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Implement hive table engine to access apache hive from clickhouse. This implements: [#29245](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/29245). [#31104](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31104) ([taiyang-li](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add aggregate functions `cramersV`, `cramersVBiasCorrected`, `theilsU` and `contingency`. These functions calculate dependency (measure of association) between categorical values. All these functions are using cross-tab (histogram on pairs) for implementation. You can imagine it like a correlation coefficient but for any discrete values (not necessary numbers). [#33366](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33366) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)). Initial implementation by [Vanyok-All-is-OK](https://github.com/Vanyok-All-is-OK) and [antikvist](https://github.com/antikvist).
* Added table function `hdfsCluster` which allows processing files from HDFS in parallel from many nodes in a specified cluster, similarly to `s3Cluster`. [#32400](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32400) ([Zhichang Yu](https://github.com/yuzhichang)).
* Adding support for disks backed by Azure Blob Storage, in a similar way it has been done for disks backed by AWS S3. [#31505](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31505) ([Jakub Kuklis](https://github.com/jkuklis)).

* Added `left`, `right`, `leftUTF8`, `rightUTF8` functions. Fix error in implementation of `substringUTF8` function with negative offset (offset from the end of string). [#33407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33407) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add new functions for `H3` coordinate system: `h3HexAreaKm2`, `h3CellAreaM2`, `h3CellAreaRads2`. [#33479](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33479) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add `MONTHNAME` function. [#33436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33436) ([usurai](https://github.com/usurai)).
* Added function `arrayLast`. Closes [#33390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33390). [#33415](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33415) Added function `arrayLastIndex`. [#33465](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33465) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Add function `decodeURLFormComponent` slightly different to `decodeURLComponent`. Close [#10298](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10298). [#33451](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33451) ([SuperDJY](https://github.com/cmsxbc)).
* Allow to split `GraphiteMergeTree` rollup rules for plain/tagged metrics (optional rule_type field). [#33494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33494) ([Michail Safronov](https://github.com/msaf1980)).


#### Performance Improvement

* Support moving conditions to `PREWHERE` (setting `optimize_move_to_prewhere`) for tables of `Merge` engine if its all underlying tables supports `PREWHERE`. [#33300](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33300) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* More efficient handling of globs for URL storage. Now you can easily query million URLs in parallel with retries. Closes [#32866](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32866). [#32907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32907) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Avoid exponential backtracking in parser. This closes [#20158](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/20158). [#33481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33481) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Abuse of `untuple` function was leading to exponential complexity of query analysis (found by fuzzer). This closes [#33297](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33297). [#33445](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33445) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Reduce allocated memory for dictionaries with string attributes. [#33466](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33466) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Slight performance improvement of `reinterpret` function. [#32587](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32587) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Non significant change. In extremely rare cases when data part is lost on every replica, after merging of some data parts, the subsequent queries may skip less amount of partitions during partition pruning. This hardly affects anything. [#32220](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32220) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Improve `clickhouse-keeper` writing performance by optimization the size calculation logic. [#32366](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32366) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Optimize single part projection materialization. This closes [#31669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31669). [#31885](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31885) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

* Optimize selecting of MergeTree parts that can be moved between volumes. [#33225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33225) ([OnePiece](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* Fix `sparse_hashed` dict performance with sequential keys (wrong hash function). [#32536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32536) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).


#### Experimental Feature

* Parallel reading from multiple replicas within a shard during distributed query without using sample key. To enable this, set `allow_experimental_parallel_reading_from_replicas = 1` and `max_parallel_replicas` to any number. This closes [#26748](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/26748). [#29279](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/29279) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Implemented sparse serialization. It can reduce usage of disk space and improve performance of some queries for columns, which contain a lot of default (zero) values. It can be enabled by setting `ratio_for_sparse_serialization`. Sparse serialization will be chosen dynamically for column, if it has ratio of number of default values to number of all values above that threshold. Serialization (default or sparse) will be fixed for every column in part, but may varies between parts. [#22535](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22535) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

* Add `EXPLAIN TABLE OVERRIDE` query. [#32836](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32836) ([Stig Bakken](https://github.com/stigsb)).
* Support TABLE OVERRIDE clause for MaterializedPostgreSQL. RFC: [#31480](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31480). [#32749](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32749) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Change ZooKeeper path for zero-copy marks for shared data. Note that "zero-copy replication" is non-production feature (in early stages of development) that you shouldn't use anyway. But in case if you have used it, let you keep in mind this change. [#32061](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32061) ([ianton-ru](https://github.com/ianton-ru)).
* Events clause support for WINDOW VIEW watch query. [#32607](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32607) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider)).
* Fix ACL with explicit digit hash in `clickhouse-keeper`: now the behavior consistent with ZooKeeper and generated digest is always accepted. [#33249](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33249) ([小路](https://github.com/nicelulu)). [#33246](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33246).
* Fix unexpected projection removal when detaching parts. [#32067](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32067) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).


#### Improvement

* Now date time conversion functions that generates time before `1970-01-01 00:00:00` will be saturated to zero instead of overflow.

It also fixes a bug in index analysis if date truncation function would yield result before the Unix epoch.
* Always display resource usage (total CPU usage, total RAM usage and max RAM usage per host) in client. [#33271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33271) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improve `Bool` type serialization and deserialization, check the range of values. [#32984](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32984) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* If an invalid setting is defined using the `SET` query or using the query parameters in the HTTP request, error message will contain suggestions that are similar to the invalid setting string (if any exists). [#32946](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32946) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Support hints for mistyped setting names for clickhouse-client and clickhouse-local. Closes [#32237](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32237). [#32841](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32841) ([凌涛](https://github.com/lingtaolf)).

* Allow negative intervals in function `intervalLengthSum`. Their length will be added as well. This closes [#33323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33323). [#33335](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33335) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `LineAsString` can be used as output format. This closes [#30919](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/30919). [#33331](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33331) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).

* Support Unix timestamp with milliseconds in `parseDateTimeBestEffort` function. [#33276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33276) ([Ben](https://github.com/benbiti)).
* Allow to cancel query while reading data from external table in the formats: `Arrow` / `Parquet` / `ORC` - it failed to be cancelled it case of big files and setting input_format_allow_seeks as false. Closes [#29678](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/29678). [#33238](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33238) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* If table engine supports `SETTINGS` clause, allow to pass the settings as key-value or via config. Add this support for MySQL. [#33231](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33231) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Correctly prevent Nullable primary keys if necessary. This is for [#32780](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32780). [#33218](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33218) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Add retry for `PostgreSQL` connections in case nothing has been fetched yet. Closes [#33199](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33199). [#33209](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33209) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
