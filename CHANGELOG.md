# 2023 Changelog

### <a id="236"></a> ClickHouse release 23.6, 2023-06-29

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Delete feature `do_not_evict_index_and_mark_files` in the fs cache. This feature was only making things worse. [#51253](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51253) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Remove ALTER support for experimental LIVE VIEW. [#51287](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51287) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Decrease the default values for `http_max_field_value_size` and `http_max_field_name_size` to 128 KiB. [#51163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51163) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* CGroups metrics related to CPU are replaced with one metric, `CGroupMaxCPU` for better usability. The `Normalized` CPU usage metrics will be normalized to CGroups limits instead of the total number of CPUs when they are set. This closes [#50836](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50836). [#50835](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50835) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### New Feature
* The function `transform` as well as `CASE` with value matching started to support all data types. This closes [#29730](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/29730). This closes [#32387](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32387). This closes [#50827](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50827). This closes [#31336](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31336). This closes [#40493](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40493). [#51351](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51351) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added option `--rename_files_after_processing <pattern>`. This closes [#34207](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34207). [#49626](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49626) ([alekseygolub](https://github.com/alekseygolub)).
* Add support for `TRUNCATE` modifier in `INTO OUTFILE` clause. Suggest using `APPEND` or `TRUNCATE` for `INTO OUTFILE` when file exists. [#50950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50950) ([alekar](https://github.com/alekar)).
* Add table engine `Redis` and table function `redis`. It allows querying external Redis servers. [#50150](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50150) ([JackyWoo](https://github.com/JackyWoo)).
* Allow to skip empty files in file/s3/url/hdfs table functions using settings `s3_skip_empty_files`, `hdfs_skip_empty_files`, `engine_file_skip_empty_files`, `engine_url_skip_empty_files`. [#50364](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50364) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add a new setting named `use_mysql_types_in_show_columns` to alter the `SHOW COLUMNS` SQL statement to display MySQL equivalent types when a client is connected via the MySQL compatibility port. [#49577](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49577) ([Thomas Panetti](https://github.com/tpanetti)).
* Clickhouse-client can now be called with a connection string instead of "--host", "--port", "--user" etc. [#50689](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50689) ([Alexey Gerasimchuck](https://github.com/Demilivor)).
* Add setting `session_timezone`; it is used as the default timezone for a session when not explicitly specified. [#44149](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44149) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Codec DEFLATE_QPL is now controlled via server setting "enable_deflate_qpl_codec" (default: false) instead of setting "allow_experimental_codecs". This marks DEFLATE_QPL non-experimental. [#50775](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50775) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Improved scheduling of merge selecting and cleanup tasks in `ReplicatedMergeTree`. The tasks will not be executed too frequently when there's nothing to merge or cleanup. Added settings `max_merge_selecting_sleep_ms`, `merge_selecting_sleep_slowdown_factor`, `max_cleanup_delay_period` and `cleanup_thread_preferred_points_per_iteration`. It should close [#31919](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31919). [#50107](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50107) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

* Rewrite CapnProto input/output format to improve its performance. Map column names and CapnProto fields case insensitive, fix reading/writing of nested structure fields. [#49752](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49752) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Optimize parquet write performance for parallel threads. [#50102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50102) ([Hongbin Ma](https://github.com/binmahone)).
* Disable `parallelize_output_from_storages` for processing MATERIALIZED VIEWs and storages with one block only. [#50214](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50214) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Merge PR [#46558](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46558). Avoid block permutation during sort if the block is already sorted. [#50697](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50697) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov), [Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Make multiple list requests to ZooKeeper in parallel to speed up reading from system.zookeeper table. [#51042](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51042) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Speedup initialization of DateTime lookup tables for time zones. This should reduce startup/connect time of clickhouse-client especially in debug build as it is rather heavy. [#51347](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51347) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Fix data lakes slowness because of synchronous head requests. (Related to Iceberg/Deltalake/Hudi being slow with a lot of files). [#50976](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50976) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Do not read all the columns from right GLOBAL JOIN table. [#50721](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50721) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Support parallel replicas with the analyzer. [#50441](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50441) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Add random sleep before large merges/mutations execution to split load more evenly between replicas in case of zero-copy replication. [#51282](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51282) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Do not replicate `ALTER PARTITION` queries and mutations through `Replicated` database if it has only one shard and the underlying table is `ReplicatedMergeTree`. [#51049](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51049) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

#### Improvement
* Relax the thresholds for "too many parts" to be more modern. Return the backpressure during long-running insert queries. [#50856](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50856) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow to cast IPv6 to IPv4 address for CIDR ::ffff:0:0/96 (IPv4-mapped addresses). [#49759](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49759) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).

* Settings `number_of_mutations_to_delay` and `number_of_mutations_to_throw` are enabled by default now with values 500 and 1000 respectively. [#50726](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50726) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* The dashboard correctly shows missing values. This closes [#50831](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50831). [#50832](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50832) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Command line parameter "--password" in clickhouse-client can now be specified only once. [#50966](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50966) ([Alexey Gerasimchuck](https://github.com/Demilivor)).
* Use `hash_of_all_files` from `system.parts` to check identity of parts during on-cluster backups. [#50997](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50997) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* The system table zookeeper_connection connected_time identifies the time when the connection is established (standard format), and session_uptime_elapsed_seconds is added, which labels the duration of the established connection session (in seconds). [#51026](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51026) ([郭小龙](https://github.com/guoxiaolongzte)).
* Improve the progress bar for file/s3/hdfs/url table functions by using chunk size from source data and using incremental total size counting in each thread. Fix the progress bar for *Cluster functions. This closes [#47250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47250). [#51088](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51088) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add total_bytes_to_read to the Progress packet in TCP protocol for better Progress bar. [#51158](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51158) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Better checking of data parts on disks with filesystem cache. [#51164](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51164) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fix sometimes not correct current_elements_num in fs cache. [#51242](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51242) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement

[#51340](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51340) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Split huge `RUN` in Dockerfile into smaller conditional. Install the necessary tools on demand in the same `RUN` layer, and remove them after that. Upgrade the OS only once at the beginning. Use a modern way to check the signed repository. Downgrade the base repo to ubuntu:20.04 to address the issues on older docker versions. Upgrade golang version to address golang vulnerabilities. [#51504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51504) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).

### <a id="235"></a> ClickHouse release 23.5, 2023-06-08

#### Upgrade Notes
* Compress marks and primary key by default. It significantly reduces the cold query time. Upgrade notes: the support for compressed marks and primary key has been added in version 22.9. If you turned on compressed marks or primary key or installed version 23.5 or newer, which has compressed marks or primary key on by default, you will not be able to downgrade to version 22.8 or earlier. You can also explicitly disable compressed marks or primary keys by specifying the `compress_marks` and `compress_primary_key` settings in the `<merge_tree>` section of the server configuration file. **Upgrade notes:** If you upgrade from versions prior to 22.9, you should either upgrade all replicas at once or disable the compression before upgrade, or upgrade through an intermediate version, where the compressed marks are supported but not enabled by default, such as 23.3. [#42587](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42587) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Make local object storage work consistently with s3 object storage, fix problem with append (closes [#48465](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48465)), make it configurable as independent storage. The change is backward incompatible because the cache on top of local object storage is not compatible to previous versions. [#48791](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48791) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* The experimental feature "in-memory data parts" is removed. The data format is still supported, but the settings are no-op, and compact or wide parts will be used instead. This closes [#45409](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45409). [#49429](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49429) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Changed default values of settings `parallelize_output_from_storages` and `input_format_parquet_preserve_order`. This allows ClickHouse to reorder rows when reading from files (e.g. CSV or Parquet), greatly improving performance in many cases. To restore the old behavior of preserving order, use `parallelize_output_from_storages = 0`, `input_format_parquet_preserve_order = 1`. [#49479](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49479) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Make projections production-ready. Add the `optimize_use_projections` setting to control whether the projections will be selected for SELECT queries. The setting `allow_experimental_projection_optimization` is obsolete and does nothing. [#49719](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49719) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Mark `joinGet` as non-deterministic (so as `dictGet`). It allows using them in mutations without an extra setting. [#49843](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49843) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Revert the "`groupArray` returns cannot be nullable" change (due to binary compatibility breakage for `groupArray`/`groupArrayLast`/`groupArraySample` over `Nullable` types, which likely will lead to `TOO_LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE` or `CANNOT_READ_ALL_DATA`). [#49971](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49971) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Setting `enable_memory_bound_merging_of_aggregation_results` is enabled by default. If you update from version prior to 22.12, we recommend to set this flag to `false` until update is finished. [#50319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50319) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).

#### New Feature
* Added storage engine AzureBlobStorage and azureBlobStorage table function. The supported set of features is very similar to storage/table function S3 [#50604] (https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50604) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni).
* Added native ClickHouse Keeper CLI Client, it is available as `clickhouse keeper-client` [#47414](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47414) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Add `urlCluster` table function. Refactor all *Cluster table functions to reduce code duplication. Make schema inference work for all possible *Cluster function signatures and for named collections. Closes [#38499](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38499). [#45427](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45427) ([attack204](https://github.com/attack204)), Pavel Kruglov.
* The query cache can now be used for production workloads. [#47977](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47977) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)). The query cache can now support queries with totals and extremes modifier. [#48853](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48853) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)). Make `allow_experimental_query_cache` setting as obsolete for backward-compatibility. It was removed in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47977. [#49934](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49934) ([Timur Solodovnikov](https://github.com/tsolodov)).
* Geographical data types (`Point`, `Ring`, `Polygon`, and `MultiPolygon`) are production-ready. [#50022](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50022) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Compress marks and primary key by default. It significantly reduces the cold query time. Upgrade notes: the support for compressed marks and primary key has been added in version 22.9. If you turned on compressed marks or primary key or installed version 23.5 or newer, which has compressed marks or primary key on by default, you will not be able to downgrade to version 22.8 or earlier. You can also explicitly disable compressed marks or primary keys by specifying the `compress_marks` and `compress_primary_key` settings in the `<merge_tree>` section of the server configuration file. [#42587](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42587) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* New setting s3_max_inflight_parts_for_one_file sets the limit of concurrently loaded parts with multipart upload request in scope of one file. [#49961](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49961) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* When reading from multiple files reduce parallel parsing threads for each file. Resolves [#42192](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42192). [#46661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46661) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Use aggregate projection only if it reads fewer granules than normal reading. It should help in case if query hits the PK of the table, but not the projection. Fixes [#49150](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49150). [#49417](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49417) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Do not store blocks in `ANY` hash join if nothing is inserted. [#48633](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48633) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Fixes aggregate combinator `-If` when JIT compiled, and enable JIT compilation for aggregate functions. Closes [#48120](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48120). [#49083](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49083) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* For reading from remote tables we use smaller tasks (instead of reading the whole part) to make tasks stealing work * task size is determined by size of columns to read * always use 1mb buffers for reading from s3 * boundaries of cache segments aligned to 1mb so they have decent size even with small tasks. it also should prevent fragmentation. [#49287](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49287) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Introduced settings: - `merge_max_block_size_bytes` to limit the amount of memory used for background operations. - `vertical_merge_algorithm_min_bytes_to_activate` to add another condition to activate vertical merges. [#49313](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49313) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Default size of a read buffer for reading from local filesystem changed to a slightly better value. Also two new settings are introduced: `max_read_buffer_size_local_fs` and `max_read_buffer_size_remote_fs`. [#49321](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49321) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Improve memory usage and speed of `SPARSE_HASHED`/`HASHED` dictionaries (e.g. `SPARSE_HASHED` now eats 2.6x less memory, and is ~2x faster). [#49380](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49380) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Optimize the `system.query_log` and `system.query_thread_log` tables by applying `LowCardinality` when appropriate. The queries over these tables will be faster. [#49530](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49530) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Better performance when reading local `Parquet` files (through parallel reading). [#49539](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49539) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Improve the performance of `RIGHT/FULL JOIN` by up to 2 times in certain scenarios, especially when joining a small left table with a large right table. [#49585](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49585) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Improve performance of BLAKE3 by 11% by enabling LTO for Rust. [#49600](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49600) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)). Now it is on par with C++.
* Optimize the structure of the `system.opentelemetry_span_log`. Use `LowCardinality` where appropriate. Although this table is generally stupid (it is using the Map data type even for common attributes), it will be slightly better. [#49647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49647) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Try to reserve hash table's size in `grace_hash` join. [#49816](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49816) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Parallel merge of `uniqExactIf` states. Closes [#49885](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49885). [#50285](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50285) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Keeper improvement: add `CheckNotExists` request to Keeper, which allows to improve the performance of Replicated tables. [#48897](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48897) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Keeper performance improvements: avoid serializing same request twice while processing. Cache deserialization results of large requests. Controlled by new coordination setting `min_request_size_for_cache`. [#49004](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49004) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Reduced number of `List` ZooKeeper requests when selecting parts to merge and a lot of partitions do not have anything to merge. [#49637](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49637) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

* Disable pure parallel replicas if trivial count optimization is possible. [#50594](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50594) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Don't send head request for all keys in Iceberg schema inference, only for keys that are used for reaing data. [#50203](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50203) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Setting `enable_memory_bound_merging_of_aggregation_results` is enabled by default. [#50319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50319) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).

#### Experimental Feature
* `DEFLATE_QPL` codec lower the minimum simd version to SSE 4.2. [doc change in qpl](https://github.com/intel/qpl/commit/3f8f5cea27739f5261e8fd577dc233ffe88bf679) - Intel® QPL relies on a run-time kernels dispatcher and cpuid check to choose the best available implementation(sse/avx2/avx512) - restructured cmakefile for qpl build in clickhouse to align with latest upstream qpl. [#49811](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49811) ([jasperzhu](https://github.com/jinjunzh)).
* Add initial support to do JOINs with pure parallel replicas. [#49544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49544) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* More parallelism on `Outdated` parts removal with "zero-copy replication". [#49630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49630) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Parallel Replicas: 1) Fixed an error `NOT_FOUND_COLUMN_IN_BLOCK` in case of using parallel replicas with non-replicated storage with disabled setting `parallel_replicas_for_non_replicated_merge_tree` 2) Now `allow_experimental_parallel_reading_from_replicas` have 3 possible values - 0, 1 and 2. 0 - disabled, 1 - enabled, silently disable them in case of failure (in case of FINAL or JOIN), 2 - enabled, throw an expection in case of failure. 3) If FINAL modifier is used in SELECT query and parallel replicas are enabled, ClickHouse will try to disable them if `allow_experimental_parallel_reading_from_replicas` is set to 1 and throw an exception otherwise. [#50195](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50195) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* When parallel replicas are enabled they will always skip unavailable servers (the behavior is controlled by the setting `skip_unavailable_shards`, enabled by default and can be only disabled). This closes: [#48565](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48565). [#50293](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50293) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

* Added setting `async_insert` for `MergeTree` tables. It has the same meaning as query-level setting `async_insert` and enables asynchronous inserts for specific table. Note: it doesn't take effect for insert queries from `clickhouse-client`, use query-level setting in that case. [#49122](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49122) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

* Added settings (`number_of_mutations_to_delay`, `number_of_mutations_to_throw`) to delay or throw `ALTER` queries that create mutations (`ALTER UPDATE`, `ALTER DELETE`, `ALTER MODIFY COLUMN`, ...) in case when table already has a lot of unfinished mutations. [#49117](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49117) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Catch exception from `create_directories` in filesystem cache. [#49203](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49203) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Copies embedded examples to a new field `example` in `system.functions` to supplement the field `description`. [#49222](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49222) ([Dan Roscigno](https://github.com/DanRoscigno)).
* Enable connection options for the MongoDB dictionary. Example: ``` xml <source> <mongodb> <host>localhost</host> <port>27017</port> <user></user> <password></password> <db>test</db> <collection>dictionary_source</collection> <options>ssl=true</options> </mongodb> </source> ``` ### Documentation entry for user-facing changes. [#49225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49225) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* Added an alias `asymptotic` for `asymp` computational method for `kolmogorovSmirnovTest`. Improved documentation. [#49286](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49286) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Aggregation function groupBitAnd/Or/Xor now work on signed integer data. This makes them consistent with the behavior of scalar functions bitAnd/Or/Xor. [#49292](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49292) ([exmy](https://github.com/exmy)).
* Split function-documentation into more fine-granular fields. [#49300](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49300) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Use multiple threads shared between all tables within a server to load outdated data parts. The the size of the pool and its queue is controlled by `max_outdated_parts_loading_thread_pool_size` and `outdated_part_loading_thread_pool_queue_size` settings. [#49317](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49317) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Don't overestimate the size of processed data for `LowCardinality` columns when they share dictionaries between blocks. This closes [#49322](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49322). See also [#48745](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48745). [#49323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49323) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Data parts loading and deletion jobs were moved to shared server-wide pools instead of per-table pools. Pools sizes are controlled via settings `max_active_parts_loading_thread_pool_size`, `max_outdated_parts_loading_thread_pool_size` and `max_parts_cleaning_thread_pool_size` in top-level config. Table-level settings `max_part_loading_threads` and `max_part_removal_threads` became obsolete. [#49474](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49474) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Allow `?password=pass` in URL of the Play UI. Password is replaced in browser history. [#49505](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49505) ([Mike Kot](https://github.com/myrrc)).
* Allow reading zero-size objects from remote filesystems. (because empty files are not backup'd, so we might end up with zero blobs in metadata file). Closes [#49480](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49480). [#49519](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49519) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

* Add compose request after multipart upload to GCS. This enables the usage of copy operation on objects uploaded with the multipart upload. It's recommended to set `s3_strict_upload_part_size` to some value because compose request can fail on objects created with parts of different sizes. [#49693](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49693) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* For the `extractKeyValuePairs` function: improve the "best-effort" parsing logic to accept `key_value_delimiter` as a valid part of the value. This also simplifies branching and might even speed up things a bit. [#49760](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49760) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Add `initial_query_id` field for system.processors_profile_log [#49777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49777) ([helifu](https://github.com/helifu)).

* Added `enable_the_endpoint_id_with_zookeeper_name_prefix` setting for `ReplicatedMergeTree` (disabled by default). When enabled, it adds ZooKeeper cluster name to table's interserver communication endpoint. It avoids `Duplicate interserver IO endpoint` errors when having replicated tables with the same path, but different auxiliary ZooKeepers. [#49780](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49780) ([helifu](https://github.com/helifu)).
* Add query parameters to `clickhouse-local`. Closes [#46561](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46561). [#49785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49785) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Allow loading dictionaries and functions from YAML by default. In previous versions, it required editing the `dictionaries_config` or `user_defined_executable_functions_config` in the configuration file, as they expected `*.xml` files.

* Add support for (an unusual) case where the arguments in the `IN` operator are single-element tuples. [#49844](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49844) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* `bitHammingDistance` function support `String` and `FixedString` data type. Closes [#48827](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48827). [#49858](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49858) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Fix timeout resetting errors in the client on OS X. [#49863](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49863) ([alekar](https://github.com/alekar)).
* Add support for big integers, such as UInt128, Int128, UInt256, and Int256 in the function `bitCount`. This enables Hamming distance over large bit masks for AI applications. [#49867](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49867) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fingerprints to be used instead of key IDs in encrypted disks. This simplifies the configuration of encrypted disks. [#49882](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49882) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add UUID data type to PostgreSQL. Closes [#49739](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49739). [#49894](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49894) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Function `toUnixTimestamp` now accepts `Date` and `Date32` arguments. [#49989](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49989) ([Victor Krasnov](https://github.com/sirvickr)).
* Charge only server memory for dictionaries. [#49995](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49995) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* The server will allow using the `SQL_*` settings such as `SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL` as no-ops for MySQL compatibility. This closes [#49927](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49927). [#50013](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50013) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Preserve initial_query_id for ON CLUSTER queries, which is useful for introspection (under `distributed_ddl_entry_format_version=5`). [#50015](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50015) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Preserve backward incompatibility for renamed settings by using aliases (`allow_experimental_projection_optimization` for `optimize_use_projections`, `allow_experimental_lightweight_delete` for `enable_lightweight_delete`). [#50044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50044) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Support passing FQDN through setting my_hostname to register cluster node in keeper. Add setting of invisible to support multi compute groups. A compute group as a cluster, is invisible to other compute groups. [#50186](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50186) ([Yangkuan Liu](https://github.com/LiuYangkuan)).
* Fix PostgreSQL reading all the data even though `LIMIT n` could be specified. [#50187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50187) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add new profile events for queries with subqueries (`QueriesWithSubqueries`/`SelectQueriesWithSubqueries`/`InsertQueriesWithSubqueries`). [#50204](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50204) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Adding the roles field in the users.xml file, which allows specifying roles with grants via a config file. [#50278](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50278) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Report `CGroupCpuCfsPeriod` and `CGroupCpuCfsQuota` in AsynchronousMetrics. - Respect cgroup v2 memory limits during server startup. [#50379](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50379) ([alekar](https://github.com/alekar)).
* Add a signal handler for SIGQUIT to work the same way as SIGINT. Closes [#50298](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50298). [#50435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50435) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* In case JSON parse fails due to the large size of the object output the last position to allow debugging. [#50474](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50474) ([Valentin Alexeev](https://github.com/valentinalexeev)).
* Support decimals with not fixed size. Closes [#49130](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49130). [#50586](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50586) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* New and improved `keeper-bench`. Everything can be customized from YAML/XML file: - request generator - each type of request generator can have a specific set of fields - multi requests can be generated just by doing the same under `multi` key - for each request or subrequest in multi a `weight` field can be defined to control distribution - define trees that need to be setup for a test run - hosts can be defined with all timeouts customizable and it's possible to control how many sessions to generate for each host - integers defined with `min_value` and `max_value` fields are random number generators.

### <a id="234"></a> ClickHouse release 23.4, 2023-04-26

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Formatter '%M' in function formatDateTime() now prints the month name instead of the minutes. This makes the behavior consistent with MySQL. The previous behavior can be restored using setting "formatdatetime_parsedatetime_m_is_month_name = 0". [#47246](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47246) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* This change makes sense only if you are using the virtual filesystem cache. If `path` in the virtual filesystem cache configuration is not empty and is not an absolute path, then it will be put in `<clickhouse server data directory>/caches/<path_from_cache_config>`. [#48784](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48784) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Primary/secondary indices and sorting keys with identical expressions are now rejected. This behavior can be disabled using setting `allow_suspicious_indices`. [#48536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48536) ([凌涛](https://github.com/lingtaolf)).

#### New Feature
* Support new aggregate function `quantileGK`/`quantilesGK`, like [approx_percentile](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#approx_percentile) in spark. Greenwald-Khanna algorithm refer to http://infolab.stanford.edu/~datar/courses/cs361a/papers/quantiles.pdf. [#46428](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46428) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add a statement `SHOW COLUMNS` which shows distilled information from system.columns. [#48017](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48017) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Added `LIGHTWEIGHT` and `PULL` modifiers for `SYSTEM SYNC REPLICA` query. `LIGHTWEIGHT` version waits for fetches and drop-ranges only (merges and mutations are ignored). `PULL` version pulls new entries from ZooKeeper and does not wait for them. Fixes [#47794](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47794). [#48085](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48085) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Add `kafkaMurmurHash` function for compatibility with Kafka DefaultPartitioner. Closes [#47834](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47834). [#48185](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48185) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Allow to easily create a user with the same grants as the current user by using `GRANT CURRENT GRANTS`. [#48262](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48262) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Add statistical aggregate function `kolmogorovSmirnovTest`. Close [#48228](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48228). [#48325](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48325) ([FFFFFFFHHHHHHH](https://github.com/FFFFFFFHHHHHHH)).
* Added a `lost_part_count` column to the `system.replicas` table. The column value shows the total number of lost parts in the corresponding table. Value is stored in zookeeper and can be used instead of not persistent `ReplicatedDataLoss` profile event for monitoring. [#48526](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48526) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Add `soundex` function for compatibility. Closes [#39880](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39880). [#48567](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48567) ([FriendLey](https://github.com/FriendLey)).
* Support `Map` type for JSONExtract. [#48629](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48629) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add `PrettyJSONEachRow` format to output pretty JSON with new line delimiters and 4 space indents. [#48898](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48898) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add `ParquetMetadata` input format to read Parquet file metadata. [#48911](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48911) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add `extractKeyValuePairs` function to extract key value pairs from strings. Input strings might contain noise (i.e. log files / do not need to be 100% formatted in key-value-pair format), the algorithm will look for key value pairs matching the arguments passed to the function. As of now, function accepts the following arguments: `data_column` (mandatory), `key_value_pair_delimiter` (defaults to `:`), `pair_delimiters` (defaults to `\space \, \;`) and `quoting_character` (defaults to double quotes). [#43606](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43606) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Functions replaceOne(), replaceAll(), replaceRegexpOne() and replaceRegexpAll() can now be called with non-const pattern and replacement arguments. [#46589](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46589) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Added functions to work with columns of type `Map`: `mapConcat`, `mapSort`, `mapExists`. [#48071](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48071) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Reading files in `Parquet` format is now much faster. IO and decoding are parallelized (controlled by `max_threads` setting), and only required data ranges are read. [#47964](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47964) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* If we run a mutation with IN (subquery) like this: `ALTER TABLE t UPDATE col='new value' WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM huge_table)` and the table `t` has multiple parts than for each part a set for subquery `SELECT id FROM huge_table` is built in memory. And if there are many parts then this might consume a lot of memory (and lead to an OOM) and CPU. The solution is to introduce a short-lived cache of sets that are currently being built by mutation tasks. If another task of the same mutation is executed concurrently it can look up the set in the cache, wait for it to be built and reuse it. [#46835](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46835) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Only check dependencies if necessary when applying `ALTER TABLE` queries. [#48062](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48062) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Optimize function `mapUpdate`. [#48118](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48118) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Now an internal query to local replica is sent explicitly and data from it received through loopback interface. Setting `prefer_localhost_replica` is not respected for parallel replicas. This is needed for better scheduling and makes the code cleaner: the initiator is only responsible for coordinating of the reading process and merging results, continuously answering for requests while all the secondary queries read the data. Note: Using loopback interface is not so performant, otherwise some replicas could starve for tasks which could lead to even slower query execution and not utilizing all possible resources. The initialization of the coordinator is now even more lazy. All incoming requests contain the information about the reading algorithm we initialize the coordinator with it when first request comes. If any replica decides to read with a different algorithm–an exception will be thrown and a query will be aborted. [#48246](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48246) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Do not build set for the right side of `IN` clause with subquery when it is used only for analysis of skip indexes, and they are disabled by setting (`use_skip_indexes=0`). Previously it might affect the performance of queries. [#48299](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48299) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Query processing is parallelized right after reading `FROM file(...)`. Related to [#38755](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38755). [#48525](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48525) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)). Query processing is parallelized right after reading from any data source. Affected data sources are mostly simple or external storages like table functions `url`, `file`. [#48727](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48727) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)). This is controlled by the setting `parallelize_output_from_storages` which is not enabled by default.
* Lowered contention of ThreadPool mutex (may increase performance for a huge amount of small jobs). [#48750](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48750) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Reduce memory usage for multiple `ALTER DELETE` mutations. [#48522](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48522) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Remove the excessive connection attempts if the `skip_unavailable_shards` setting is enabled. [#48771](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48771) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Entries in the query cache are now squashed to max_block_size and compressed. [#45912](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45912) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* It is now possible to define per-user quotas in the query cache. [#48284](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48284) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Some fixes for parallel replicas [#48433](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48433) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Implement zero-copy-replication (an experimental feature) on encrypted disks. [#48741](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48741) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).

#### Improvement
* Increase default value for `connect_timeout_with_failover_ms` to 1000 ms (because of adding async connections in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47229) . Closes [#5188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5188). [#49009](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49009) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Several improvements around data lakes: - Make `Iceberg` work with non-partitioned data. - Support `Iceberg` format version v2 (previously only v1 was supported) - Support reading partitioned data for `DeltaLake`/`Hudi` - Faster reading of `DeltaLake` metadata by using Delta's checkpoint files - Fixed incorrect `Hudi` reads: previously it incorrectly chose which data to read and therefore was able to read correctly only small size tables - Made these engines to pickup updates of changed data (previously the state was set on table creation) - Make proper testing for `Iceberg`/`DeltaLake`/`Hudi` using spark. [#47307](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47307) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add async connection to socket and async writing to socket. Make creating connections and sending query/external tables async across shards. Refactor code with fibers. Closes [#46931](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46931). We will be able to increase `connect_timeout_with_failover_ms` by default after this PR (https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5188). [#47229](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47229) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support config sections `keeper`/`keeper_server` as an alternative to `zookeeper`. Close [#34766](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34766) , [#34767](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34767). [#35113](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35113) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* It is possible to set _secure_ flag in named_collections for a dictionary with a ClickHouse table source. Addresses [#38450](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38450) . [#46323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46323) ([Ilya Golshtein](https://github.com/ilejn)).
* `bitCount` function support `FixedString` and `String` data type. [#49044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49044) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Added configurable retries for all operations with [Zoo]Keeper for Backup queries. [#47224](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47224) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Enable `use_environment_credentials` for S3 by default, so the entire provider chain is constructed by default. [#47397](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47397) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Currently, the JSON_VALUE function is similar as spark's get_json_object function, which support to get value from JSON string by a path like '$.key'. But still has something different - 1. in spark's get_json_object will return null while the path is not exist, but in JSON_VALUE will return empty string; - 2. in spark's get_json_object will return a complex type value, such as a JSON object/array value, but in JSON_VALUE will return empty string. [#47494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47494) ([KevinyhZou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* For `use_structure_from_insertion_table_in_table_functions` more flexible insert table structure propagation to table function. Fixed an issue with name mapping and using virtual columns. No more need for 'auto' setting. [#47962](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47962) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Do not continue retrying to connect to Keeper if the query is killed or over limits. [#47985](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47985) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Support Enum output/input in `BSONEachRow`, allow all map key types and avoid extra calculations on output. [#48122](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48122) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support more ClickHouse types in `ORC`/`Arrow`/`Parquet` formats: Enum(8|16), (U)Int(128|256), Decimal256 (for ORC), allow reading IPv4 from Int32 values (ORC outputs IPv4 as Int32, and we couldn't read it back), fix reading Nullable(IPv6) from binary data for `ORC`. [#48126](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48126) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add columns `perform_ttl_move_on_insert`, `load_balancing` for table `system.storage_policies`, modify column `volume_type` type to `Enum8`. [#48167](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48167) ([lizhuoyu5](https://github.com/lzydmxy)).
* Added support for `BACKUP ALL` command which backups all tables and databases, including temporary and system ones. [#48189](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48189) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Function mapFromArrays supports `Map` type as an input. [#48207](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48207) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* The output of some SHOW PROCESSLIST is now sorted. [#48241](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48241) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Per-query/per-server throttling for remote IO/local IO/BACKUPs (server settings: `max_remote_read_network_bandwidth_for_server`, `max_remote_write_network_bandwidth_for_server`, `max_local_read_bandwidth_for_server`, `max_local_write_bandwidth_for_server`, `max_backup_bandwidth_for_server`, settings: `max_remote_read_network_bandwidth`, `max_remote_write_network_bandwidth`, `max_local_read_bandwidth`, `max_local_write_bandwidth`, `max_backup_bandwidth`). [#48242](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48242) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Support more types in `CapnProto` format: Map, (U)Int(128|256), Decimal(128|256). Allow integer conversions during input/output. [#48257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48257) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Don't throw CURRENT_WRITE_BUFFER_IS_EXHAUSTED for normal behaviour. [#48288](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48288) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Add new setting `keeper_map_strict_mode` which enforces extra guarantees on operations made on top of `KeeperMap` tables. [#48293](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48293) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Check primary key type for simple dictionary is native unsigned integer type Add setting `check_dictionary_primary_key ` for compatibility(set `check_dictionary_primary_key =false` to disable checking). [#48335](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48335) ([lizhuoyu5](https://github.com/lzydmxy)).
* Don't replicate mutations for `KeeperMap` because it's unnecessary. [#48354](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48354) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Allow to write/read unnamed tuple as nested Message in Protobuf format. Tuple elements and Message fields are matched by position. [#48390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48390) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support `additional_table_filters` and `additional_result_filter` settings in the new planner. Also, add a documentation entry for `additional_result_filter`. [#48405](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48405) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* `parseDateTime` now understands format string '%f' (fractional seconds). [#48420](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48420) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Format string "%f" in formatDateTime() now prints "000000" if the formatted value has no fractional seconds, the previous behavior (single zero) can be restored using setting "formatdatetime_f_prints_single_zero = 1". [#48422](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48422) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Don't replicate DELETE and TRUNCATE for KeeperMap. [#48434](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48434) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Generate valid Decimals and Bools in generateRandom function. [#48436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48436) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow trailing commas in expression list of SELECT query, for example `SELECT a, b, c, FROM table`. Closes [#37802](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37802). [#48438](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48438) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Override `CLICKHOUSE_USER` and `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` environment variables with `--user` and `--password` client parameters. Closes [#38909](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38909). [#48440](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48440) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Added retries to loading of data parts in `MergeTree` tables in case of retryable errors. [#48442](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48442) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Add support for `Date`, `Date32`, `DateTime`, `DateTime64` data types to `arrayMin`, `arrayMax`, `arrayDifference` functions. Closes [#21645](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21645). [#48445](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48445) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Add support for `{server_uuid}` macro. It is useful for identifying replicas in autoscaled clusters when new replicas are constantly added and removed in runtime. This closes [#48554](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48554). [#48563](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48563) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The installation script will create a hard link instead of copying if it is possible. [#48578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48578) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support `SHOW TABLE` syntax meaning the same as `SHOW CREATE TABLE`. Closes [#48580](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48580). [#48591](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48591) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* HTTP temporary buffers now support working by evicting data from the virtual filesystem cache. [#48664](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48664) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Make Schema inference works for `CREATE AS SELECT`. Closes [#47599](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47599). [#48679](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48679) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Added a `replicated_max_mutations_in_one_entry` setting for `ReplicatedMergeTree` that allows limiting the number of mutation commands per one `MUTATE_PART` entry (default is 10000). [#48731](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48731) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* In AggregateFunction types, don't count unused arena bytes as `read_bytes`. [#48745](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48745) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Fix some MySQL-related settings not being handled with the MySQL dictionary source + named collection. Closes [#48402](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48402). [#48759](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48759) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* If a user set `max_single_part_upload_size` to a very large value, it can lead to a crash due to a bug in the AWS S3 SDK. This fixes [#47679](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47679). [#48816](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48816) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix data race in `RabbitMQ` ([report](https://pastila.nl/?004f7100/de1505289ab5bb355e67ebe6c7cc8707)), refactor the code. [#48845](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48845) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add aliases `name` and `part_name` form `system.parts` and `system.part_log`. Closes [#48718](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48718). [#48850](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48850) ([sichenzhao](https://github.com/sichenzhao)).
* Functions "arrayDifferenceSupport()", "arrayCumSum()" and "arrayCumSumNonNegative()" now support input arrays of wide integer types (U)Int128/256. [#48866](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48866) ([cluster](https://github.com/infdahai)).
* Multi-line history in clickhouse-client is now no longer padded. This makes pasting more natural. [#48870](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48870) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Implement a slight improvement for the rare case when ClickHouse is run inside LXC and LXCFS is used. The LXCFS has an issue: sometimes it returns an error "Transport endpoint is not connected" on reading from the file inside `/proc`. This error was correctly logged into ClickHouse's server log. We have additionally workaround this issue by reopening a file. This is a minuscule change. [#48922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48922) ([Real](https://github.com/RunningXie)).

* In previous versions, the `LineAsString` format worked inconsistently when the parallel parsing was enabled or not, in presence of DOS or macOS Classic line breaks. This closes [#49039](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49039). [#49052](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49052) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The exception message about the unparsed query parameter will also tell about the name of the parameter. Reimplement [#48878](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48878). Close [#48772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48772). [#49061](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/49061) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### <a id="233"></a> ClickHouse release 23.3 LTS, 2023-03-30

#### Upgrade Notes
* Lightweight DELETEs are production ready and enabled by default. The `DELETE` query for MergeTree tables is now available by default.
* The behavior of `*domain*RFC` and `netloc` functions is slightly changed: relaxed the set of symbols that are allowed in the URL authority for better conformance. [#46841](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46841) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Prohibited creating tables based on KafkaEngine with DEFAULT/EPHEMERAL/ALIAS/MATERIALIZED statements for columns. [#47138](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47138) ([Aleksandr Musorin](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).
* An "asynchronous connection drain" feature is removed. Related settings and metrics are removed as well. It was an internal feature, so the removal should not affect users who had never heard about that feature. [#47486](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47486) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Support 256-bit Decimal data type (more than 38 digits) in `arraySum`/`Min`/`Max`/`Avg`/`Product`, `arrayCumSum`/`CumSumNonNegative`, `arrayDifference`, array construction, IN operator, query parameters, `groupArrayMovingSum`, statistical functions, `min`/`max`/`any`/`argMin`/`argMax`, PostgreSQL wire protocol, MySQL table engine and function, `sumMap`, `mapAdd`, `mapSubtract`, `arrayIntersect`. Add support for big integers in `arrayIntersect`. Statistical aggregate functions involving moments (such as `corr` or various `TTest`s) will use `Float64` as their internal representation (they were using `Decimal128` before this change, but it was pointless), and these functions can return `nan` instead of `inf` in case of infinite variance. Some functions were allowed on `Decimal256` data types but returned `Decimal128` in previous versions - now it is fixed. This closes [#47569](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47569). This closes [#44864](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44864). This closes [#28335](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28335). [#47594](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47594) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Make backup_threads/restore_threads server settings (instead of user settings). [#47881](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47881) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Do not allow const and non-deterministic secondary indices [#46839](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46839) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

#### New Feature
* Add a new mode for splitting the work on replicas using settings `parallel_replicas_custom_key` and `parallel_replicas_custom_key_filter_type`. If the cluster consists of a single shard with multiple replicas, up to `max_parallel_replicas` will be randomly picked and turned into shards. For each shard, a corresponding filter is added to the query on the initiator before being sent to the shard. If the cluster consists of multiple shards, it will behave the same as `sample_key` but with the possibility to define an arbitrary key. [#45108](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45108) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* An option to display partial result on cancel: Added query setting `partial_result_on_first_cancel` allowing the canceled query (e.g. due to Ctrl-C) to return a partial result. [#45689](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45689) ([Alexey Perevyshin](https://github.com/alexX512)).
* Added support of arbitrary tables engines for temporary tables (except for Replicated and KeeperMap engines). Close [#31497](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31497). [#46071](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46071) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* Add support for replication of user-defined SQL functions using centralized storage in Keeper. [#46085](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46085) ([Aleksei Filatov](https://github.com/aalexfvk)).
* Implement `system.server_settings` (similar to `system.settings`), which will contain server configurations. [#46550](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46550) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Support for `UNDROP TABLE` query. Closes [#46811](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46811). [#47241](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47241) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Allow separate grants for named collections (e.g. to be able to give `SHOW/CREATE/ALTER/DROP named collection` access only to certain collections, instead of all at once). Closes [#40894](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40894). Add new access type `NAMED_COLLECTION_CONTROL` which is not given to user default unless explicitly added to the user config (is required to be able to do `GRANT ALL`), also `show_named_collections` is no longer obligatory to be manually specified for user default to be able to have full access rights as was in 23.2. [#46241](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46241) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Allow nested custom disks. Previously custom disks supported only flat disk structure. [#47106](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47106) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Introduce a function `widthBucket` (with a `WIDTH_BUCKET` alias for compatibility). [#42974](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42974). [#46790](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46790) ([avoiderboi](https://github.com/avoiderboi)).
* Add new function `parseDateTime`/`parseDateTimeInJodaSyntax` according to the specified format string. parseDateTime parses String to DateTime in MySQL syntax, parseDateTimeInJodaSyntax parses in Joda syntax. [#46815](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46815) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Use `dummy UInt8` for the default structure of table function `null`. Closes [#46930](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46930). [#47006](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47006) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Support for date format with a comma, like `Dec 15, 2021` in the `parseDateTimeBestEffort` function. Closes [#46816](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46816). [#47071](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47071) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Add settings `http_wait_end_of_query` and `http_response_buffer_size` that corresponds to URL params `wait_end_of_query` and `buffer_size` for the HTTP interface. This allows changing these settings in the profiles. [#47108](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47108) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Add `system.dropped_tables` table that shows tables that were dropped from `Atomic` databases but were not completely removed yet. [#47364](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47364) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Add `INSTR` as alias of `positionCaseInsensitive` for MySQL compatibility. Closes [#47529](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47529). [#47535](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47535) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Added `toDecimalString` function allowing to convert numbers to string with fixed precision. [#47838](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47838) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Add a merge tree setting `max_number_of_mutations_for_replica`. It limits the number of part mutations per replica to the specified amount. Zero means no limit on the number of mutations per replica (the execution can still be constrained by other settings). [#48047](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48047) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Add the Map-related function `mapFromArrays`, which allows the creation of a map from a pair of arrays. [#31125](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31125) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Allow control of compression in Parquet/ORC/Arrow output formats, adds support for more compression input formats. This closes [#13541](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13541). [#47114](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47114) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add SSL User Certificate authentication to the native protocol. Closes [#47077](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47077). [#47596](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47596) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Add *OrNull() and *OrZero() variants for `parseDateTime`, add alias `str_to_date` for MySQL parity. [#48000](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48000) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Added operator `REGEXP` (similar to operators "LIKE", "IN", "MOD" etc.) for better compatibility with MySQL [#47869](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47869) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Marks in memory are now compressed, using 3-6x less memory. [#47290](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47290) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Backups for large numbers of files were unbelievably slow in previous versions. Not anymore. Now they are unbelievably fast. [#47251](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47251) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)). Introduced a separate thread pool for backup's IO operations. This will allow scaling it independently of other pools and increase performance. [#47174](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47174) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)). Use MultiRead request and retries for collecting metadata at the final stage of backup processing. [#47243](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47243) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)). If a backup and restoring data are both in S3 then server-side copy should be used from now on. [#47546](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47546) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Fixed excessive reading in queries with `FINAL`. [#47801](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47801) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Setting `max_final_threads` would be set to the number of cores at server startup (by the same algorithm as used for `max_threads`). This improves the concurrency of `final` execution on servers with high number of CPUs. [#47915](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47915) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Allow executing reading pipeline for DIRECT dictionary with CLICKHOUSE source in multiple threads. To enable set `dictionary_use_async_executor=1` in `SETTINGS` section for source in `CREATE DICTIONARY` statement. [#47986](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47986) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Optimize one nullable key aggregate performance. [#45772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45772) ([LiuNeng](https://github.com/liuneng1994)).
* Implemented lowercase `tokenbf_v1` index utilization for `hasTokenOrNull`, `hasTokenCaseInsensitive` and `hasTokenCaseInsensitiveOrNull`. [#46252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46252) ([ltrk2](https://github.com/ltrk2)).
* Optimize functions `position` and `LIKE` by searching the first two chars using SIMD. [#46289](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46289) ([Jiebin Sun](https://github.com/jiebinn)).
* Optimize queries from the `system.detached_parts`, which could be significantly large. Added several sources with respect to the block size limitation; in each block, an IO thread pool is used to calculate the part size, i.e. to make syscalls in parallel. [#46624](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46624) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Increase the default value of `max_replicated_merges_in_queue` for ReplicatedMergeTree tables from 16 to 1000. It allows faster background merge operation on clusters with a very large number of replicas, such as clusters with shared storage in ClickHouse Cloud. [#47050](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47050) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Updated `clickhouse-copier` to use `GROUP BY` instead of `DISTINCT` to get the list of partitions. For large tables, this reduced the select time from over 500s to under 1s. [#47386](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47386) ([Clayton McClure](https://github.com/cmcclure-twilio)).
* Fix performance degradation in `ASOF JOIN`. [#47544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47544) ([Ongkong](https://github.com/ongkong)).
* Even more batching in Keeper. Improve performance by avoiding breaking batches on read requests. [#47978](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47978) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Allow PREWHERE for Merge with different DEFAULT expressions for columns. [#46831](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46831) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Parallel replicas: Improved the overall performance by better utilizing the local replica, and forbid the reading with parallel replicas from non-replicated MergeTree by default. [#47858](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47858) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Support filter push down to left table for JOIN with `Join`, `Dictionary` and `EmbeddedRocksDB` tables if the experimental Analyzer is enabled. [#47280](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47280) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Now ReplicatedMergeTree with zero copy replication has less load to Keeper. [#47676](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47676) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Fix create materialized view with MaterializedPostgreSQL [#40807](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40807) ([Maksim Buren](https://github.com/maks-buren630501)).

#### Improvement
* Enable `input_format_json_ignore_unknown_keys_in_named_tuple` by default. [#46742](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46742) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

This column holds the value of [SpanKind](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/api/#spankind) defined in OpenTelemtry. [#47499](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47499) ([Frank Chen](https://github.com/FrankChen021)).
* Allow reading/writing nested arrays in `Protobuf` format with only the root field name as column name. Previously column name should've contained all nested field names (like `a.b.c Array(Array(Array(UInt32)))`, now you can use just `a Array(Array(Array(UInt32)))`. [#47650](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47650) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Improved error handling in the code related to Decimal parameters, resulting in more informative error messages. Previously, when incorrect Decimal parameters were supplied, the error message generated was unclear or unhelpful. With this update, the error message printed has been fixed to provide more detailed and useful information, making it easier to identify and correct issues related to Decimal parameters. [#47812](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47812) ([Yu Feng](https://github.com/Vigor-jpg)). Note: this changelog entry is rewritten by ChatGPT.
* The parameter `exact_rows_before_limit` is used to make `rows_before_limit_at_least` is designed to accurately reflect the number of rows returned before the limit is reached. This pull request addresses issues encountered when the query involves distributed processing across multiple shards or sorting operations.

### <a id="232"></a> ClickHouse release 23.2, 2023-02-23

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Extend function "toDayOfWeek()" (alias: "DAYOFWEEK") with a mode argument that encodes whether the week starts on Monday or Sunday and whether counting starts at 0 or 1. For consistency with other date time functions, the mode argument was inserted between the time and the time zone arguments. This breaks existing usage of the (previously undocumented) 2-argument syntax "toDayOfWeek(time, time_zone)". A fix is to rewrite the function into "toDayOfWeek(time, 0, time_zone)". [#45233](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45233) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Rename setting `max_query_cache_size` to `filesystem_cache_max_download_size`. [#45614](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45614) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* The `default` user will not have permissions for access type `SHOW NAMED COLLECTION` by default (e.g. `default` user will no longer be able to grant ALL to other users as it was before, therefore this PR is backward incompatible). [#46010](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46010) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* If the SETTINGS clause is specified before the FORMAT clause, the settings will be applied to formatting as well. [#46003](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46003) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Remove support for setting `materialized_postgresql_allow_automatic_update` (which was by default turned off). [#46106](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46106) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Slightly improve performance of `countDigits` on realistic datasets. This closed [#44518](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44518). In previous versions, `countDigits(0)` returned `0`; now it returns `1`, which is more correct, and follows the existing documentation. [#46187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46187) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Disallow creation of new columns compressed by a combination of codecs "Delta" or "DoubleDelta" followed by codecs "Gorilla" or "FPC". This can be bypassed using setting "allow_suspicious_codecs = true". [#45652](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45652) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

#### New Feature
* Add `StorageIceberg` and table function `iceberg` to access iceberg table store on S3. [#45384](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45384) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Allow configuring storage as `SETTINGS disk = '<disk_name>'` (instead of `storage_policy`) and with explicit disk creation `SETTINGS disk = disk(type=s3, ...)`. [#41976](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41976) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Expose `ProfileEvents` counters in `system.part_log`. [#38614](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38614) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Enrichment of the existing `ReplacingMergeTree` engine to allow duplicate the insertion. It leverages the power of both `ReplacingMergeTree` and `CollapsingMergeTree` in one MergeTree engine. Deleted data are not returned when queried, but not removed from disk neither. [#41005](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41005) ([youennL-cs](https://github.com/youennL-cs)).
* Add `generateULID` function. Closes [#36536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36536). [#44662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44662) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Add `corrMatrix` aggregate function, calculating each two columns. In addition, since Aggregatefunctions `covarSamp` and `covarPop` are similar to `corr`, I add `covarSampMatrix`, `covarPopMatrix` by the way. @alexey-milovidov closes [#44587](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44587). [#44680](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44680) ([FFFFFFFHHHHHHH](https://github.com/FFFFFFFHHHHHHH)).
* Introduce arrayShuffle function for random array permutations. [#45271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45271) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Support types `FIXED_SIZE_BINARY` type in Arrow, `FIXED_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAY` in `Parquet` and match them to `FixedString`. Add settings `output_format_parquet_fixed_string_as_fixed_byte_array/output_format_arrow_fixed_string_as_fixed_byte_array` to control default output type for FixedString. Closes [#45326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45326). [#45340](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45340) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add a new column `last_exception_time` to system.replication_queue. [#45457](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45457) ([Frank Chen](https://github.com/FrankChen021)).
* Add two new functions which allow for user-defined keys/seeds with SipHash{64,128}. [#45513](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45513) ([Salvatore Mesoraca](https://github.com/aiven-sal)).
* Allow a three-argument version for table function `format`. close [#45808](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45808). [#45873](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45873) ([FFFFFFFHHHHHHH](https://github.com/FFFFFFFHHHHHHH)).
* Add `JodaTime` format support for 'x','w','S'. Refer to https://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html. [#46073](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46073) ([zk_kiger](https://github.com/zk-kiger)).
* Support window function `ntile`. ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Add setting `final` to implicitly apply the `FINAL` modifier to every table. [#40945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40945) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Added `arrayPartialSort` and `arrayPartialReverseSort` functions. [#46296](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46296) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* The new http parameter `client_protocol_version` allows setting a client protocol version for HTTP responses using the Native format. [#40397](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40397). [#46360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46360) ([Geoff Genz](https://github.com/genzgd)).
* Add new function `regexpExtract`, like spark function `REGEXP_EXTRACT` for compatibility. It is similar to the existing function `extract`. [#46469](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46469) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add new function `JSONArrayLength`, which returns the number of elements in the outermost JSON array. The function returns NULL if the input JSON string is invalid. [#46631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46631) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).

#### Performance Improvement
* The introduced logic works if PREWHERE condition is a conjunction of multiple conditions (cond1 AND cond2 AND ... ). It groups those conditions that require reading the same columns into steps. After each step the corresponding part of the full condition is computed and the result rows might be filtered. This allows to read fewer rows in the next steps thus saving IO bandwidth and doing less computation. This logic is disabled by default for now. It will be enabled by default in one of the future releases once it is known to not have any regressions, so it is highly encouraged to be used for testing. It can be controlled by 2 settings: "enable_multiple_prewhere_read_steps" and "move_all_conditions_to_prewhere". [#46140](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46140) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* An option added to aggregate partitions independently if table partition key and group by key are compatible. Controlled by the setting `allow_aggregate_partitions_independently`. Disabled by default because of limited applicability (please refer to the docs). [#45364](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45364) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Allow using Vertical merge algorithm with parts in Compact format. This will allow ClickHouse server to use much less memory for background operations. This closes [#46084](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46084). [#45681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45681) [#46282](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46282) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Optimize `Parquet` reader by using batch reader. [#45878](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45878) ([LiuNeng](https://github.com/liuneng1994)).
* Add new `local_filesystem_read_method` method `io_uring` based on the asynchronous Linux [io_uring](https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf) subsystem, improving read performance almost universally compared to the default `pread` method. [#38456](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38456) ([Saulius Valatka](https://github.com/sauliusvl)).
* Rewrite aggregate functions with `if` expression as argument when logically equivalent. For example, `avg(if(cond, col, null))` can be rewritten to avgIf(cond, col). It is helpful in performance. [#44730](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44730) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improve lower/upper function performance with avx512 instructions. [#37894](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37894) ([yaqi-zhao](https://github.com/yaqi-zhao)).
* Remove the limitation that on systems with >=32 cores and SMT disabled ClickHouse uses only half of the cores (the case when you disable Hyper Threading in BIOS). [#44973](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44973) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Improve performance of function `multiIf` by columnar executing, speed up by 2.3x. [#45296](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45296) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add fast path for function `position` when the needle is empty. [#45382](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45382) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Enable `query_plan_remove_redundant_sorting` optimization by default. Optimization implemented in [#45420](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45420). [#45567](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45567) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Increased HTTP Transfer Encoding chunk size to improve performance of large queries using the HTTP interface. [#45593](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45593) ([Geoff Genz](https://github.com/genzgd)).
* Fixed performance of short `SELECT` queries that read from tables with large number of `Array`/`Map`/`Nested` columns. [#45630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45630) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improve performance of filtering for big integers and decimal types. [#45949](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45949) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* This change could effectively reduce the overhead of obtaining the filter from ColumnNullable(UInt8) and improve the overall query performance. To evaluate the impact of this change, we adopted TPC-H benchmark but revised the column types from non-nullable to nullable, and we measured the QPS of its queries as the performance indicator. [#45962](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45962) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Make the `_part` and `_partition_id` virtual column be `LowCardinality(String)` type. Closes [#45964](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45964). [#45975](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45975) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Improve the performance of Decimal conversion when the scale does not change. [#46095](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46095) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow to increase prefetching for read data. [#46168](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46168) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Rewrite `arrayExists(x -> x = 1, arr)` -> `has(arr, 1)`, which improve performance by 1.34x. [#46188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46188) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Fix too big memory usage for vertical merges on non-remote disk. Respect `max_insert_delayed_streams_for_parallel_write` for the remote disk. [#46275](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46275) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Update zstd to v1.5.4. It has some minor improvements in performance and compression ratio. If you run replicas with different versions of ClickHouse you may see reasonable error messages `Data after merge/mutation is not byte-identical to data on another replicas.` with explanation. These messages are Ok and you should not worry. [#46280](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46280) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Fix performance degradation caused by [#39737](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39737). [#46309](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46309) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `replicas_status` handle will answer quickly even in case of a large replication queue. [#46310](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46310) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add avx512 support for aggregate function `sum`, function unary arithmetic, function comparison. [#37870](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37870) ([zhao zhou](https://github.com/zzachimed)).
* Rewrote the code around marks distribution and the overall coordination of the reading in order to achieve the maximum performance improvement. This closes [#34527](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34527). [#43772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43772) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Remove redundant DISTINCT clauses in query (subqueries). Implemented on top of query plan. It does similar optimization as `optimize_duplicate_order_by_and_distinct` regarding DISTINCT clauses. Can be enabled via `query_plan_remove_redundant_distinct` setting. Related to [#42648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42648). [#44176](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44176) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* A few query rewrite optimizations: `sumIf(123, cond) -> 123 * countIf(1, cond)`, `sum(if(cond, 123, 0)) -> 123 * countIf(cond)`, `sum(if(cond, 0, 123)) -> 123 * countIf(not(cond))` [#44728](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44728) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improved how memory bound merging and aggregation in order on top query plan interact. Previously we fell back to explicit sorting for AIO in some cases when it wasn't actually needed. [#45892](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45892) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Concurrent merges are scheduled using round-robin by default to ensure fair and starvation-free operation. Previously in heavily overloaded shards, big merges could possibly be starved by smaller merges due to the use of strict priority scheduling. Added `background_merges_mutations_scheduling_policy` server config option to select scheduling algorithm (`round_robin` or `shortest_task_first`). [#46247](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46247) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).

#### Improvement
* Enable retries for INSERT by default in case of ZooKeeper session loss. We already use it in production. [#46308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46308) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add ability to ignore unknown keys in JSON object for named tuples (`input_format_json_ignore_unknown_keys_in_named_tuple`). [#45678](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45678) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Support optimizing the `where` clause with sorting key expression move to `prewhere`  for query with `final`. [#38893](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38893). [#38950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38950) ([hexiaoting](https://github.com/hexiaoting)).
* Add new metrics for backups: num_processed_files and processed_files_size described actual number of processed files. [#42244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42244) ([Aleksandr](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).
* Added retries on interserver DNS errors. [#43179](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43179) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* Keeper improvement: try preallocating space on the disk to avoid undefined out-of-space issues. Introduce setting `max_log_file_size` for the maximum size of Keeper's Raft log files. [#44370](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44370) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Optimize behavior for a replica delay api logic in case the replica is read-only. [#45148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45148) ([mateng915](https://github.com/mateng0915)).
* Ask for the password in clickhouse-client interactively in a case when the empty password is wrong. Closes [#46702](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46702). [#46730](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46730) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)). 
* Mark `Gorilla` compression on columns of non-Float* type as suspicious. [#45376](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45376) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Show replica name that is executing a merge in the `postpone_reason` column. [#45458](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45458) ([Frank Chen](https://github.com/FrankChen021)).
* Save exception stack trace in part_log. [#45459](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45459) ([Frank Chen](https://github.com/FrankChen021)).
* The `regexp_tree` dictionary is polished and now it is compatible with https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core. [#45631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45631) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Updated checking of `SYSTEM SYNC REPLICA`, resolves [#45508](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45508) [#45648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45648) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Rename setting `replication_alter_partitions_sync` to `alter_sync`. [#45659](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45659) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* The `generateRandom` table function and the engine now support `LowCardinality` data types. This is useful for testing, for example you can write `INSERT INTO table SELECT * FROM generateRandom() LIMIT 1000`. This is needed to debug [#45590](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45590). [#45661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45661) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The experimental query result cache now provides more modular configuration settings. [#45679](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45679) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Renamed "query result cache" to "query cache". [#45682](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45682) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* add `SYSTEM SYNC FILE CACHE` command. It will do the `sync` syscall. [#8921](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8921). [#45685](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45685) ([DR](https://github.com/freedomDR)).
* Add a new S3 setting `allow_head_object_request`. This PR makes usage of `GetObjectAttributes` request instead of `HeadObject` introduced in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45288 optional (and disabled by default). [#45701](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45701) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add ability to override connection settings based on connection names (that said that now you can forget about storing password for each connection, you can simply put everything into `~/.clickhouse-client/config.xml` and even use different history files for them, which can be also useful). [#45715](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45715) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Arrow format: support the duration type. Closes [#45669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45669). [#45750](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45750) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Extend the logging in the Query Cache to improve investigations of the caching behavior. [#45751](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45751) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* The query cache's server-level settings are now reconfigurable at runtime. [#45758](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45758) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Hide password in logs when a table function's arguments are specified with a named collection. [#45774](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45774) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Improve internal S3 client to correctly deduce regions and redirections for different types of URLs. [#45783](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45783) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add support for Map, IPv4 and IPv6 types in generateRandom. Mostly useful for testing. [#45785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45785) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Support empty/notEmpty for IP types. [#45799](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45799) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* The column `num_processed_files` was split into two columns: `num_files` (for BACKUP) and `files_read` (for RESTORE). The column `processed_files_size` was split into two columns: `total_size` (for BACKUP) and `bytes_read` (for RESTORE). [#45800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45800) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add support for `SHOW ENGINES` query for MySQL compatibility. [#45859](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45859) ([Filatenkov Artur](https://github.com/FArthur-cmd)).
* Improved how the obfuscator deals with queries. [#45867](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45867) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improve behaviour of conversion into Date for boundary value 65535 (2149-06-06). [#46042](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46042) [#45914](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45914) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Add setting `check_referential_table_dependencies` to check referential dependencies on `DROP TABLE`. This PR solves [#38326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38326). [#45936](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45936) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Fix `tupleElement` to return `Null` when having `Null` argument. Closes [#45894](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45894). [#45952](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45952) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Throw an error on no files satisfying the S3 wildcard. Closes [#45587](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45587). [#45957](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45957) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Use cluster state data to check concurrent backup/restore. [#45982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45982) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* ClickHouse Client: Use "exact" matching for fuzzy search, which has correct case ignorance and more appropriate algorithm for matching SQL queries. [#46000](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46000) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Forbid wrong create View syntax `CREATE View X TO Y AS SELECT`. Closes [#4331](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4331). [#46043](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46043) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Storage `Log` family support setting the `storage_policy`. Closes [#43421](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43421). [#46044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46044) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Improve `JSONColumns` format when the result is empty. Closes [#46024](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46024). [#46053](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46053) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Add reference implementation for SipHash128. [#46065](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46065) ([Salvatore Mesoraca](https://github.com/aiven-sal)).
* Add a new metric to record allocations times and bytes using mmap. [#46068](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46068) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Currently for functions like `leftPad`, `rightPad`, `leftPadUTF8`, `rightPadUTF8`, the second argument `length` must be UInt8|16|32|64|128|256. Which is too strict for clickhouse users, besides, it is not consistent with other similar functions like `arrayResize`, `substring` and so on. [#46103](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46103) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Fix assertion in the `welchTTest` function in debug build when the resulting statistics is NaN. Unified the behavior with other similar functions. Change the behavior of `studentTTest` to return NaN instead of throwing an exception because the previous behavior was inconvenient. This closes [#41176](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41176) This closes [#42162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42162). [#46141](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46141) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* More convenient usage of big integers and ORDER BY WITH FILL. Allow using plain integers for start and end points in WITH FILL when ORDER BY big (128-bit and 256-bit) integers. Fix the wrong result for big integers with negative start or end points. This closes [#16733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16733). [#46152](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46152) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Functions "multi[Fuzzy]Match(Any|AnyIndex|AllIndices}" now reject regexes which will likely evaluate very slowly in vectorscan. [#46167](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46167) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* When `insert_null_as_default` is enabled and column doesn't have defined default value, the default of column type will be used. Also this PR fixes using default values on nulls in case of LowCardinality columns. [#46171](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46171) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Prefer explicitly defined access keys for S3 clients. If `use_environment_credentials` is set to `true`, and the user has provided the access key through query or config, they will be used instead of the ones from the environment variable. [#46191](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46191) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add an alias "DATE_FORMAT()" for function "formatDateTime()" to improve compatibility with MySQL's SQL dialect, extend function `formatDateTime` with substitutions "a", "b", "c", "h", "i", "k", "l" "r", "s", "W". ### Documentation entry for user-facing changes User-readable short description: `DATE_FORMAT` is an alias of `formatDateTime`. Formats a Time according to the given Format string. Format is a constant expression, so you cannot have multiple formats for a single result column. (Provide link to [formatDateTime](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/date-time-functions/#formatdatetime)). [#46302](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46302) ([Jake Bamrah](https://github.com/JakeBamrah)).

* Exclude the internal database used for temporary/external tables from the calculation of asynchronous metric "NumberOfDatabases". This makes the behavior consistent with system table "system.databases". [#46435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46435) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Added `last_exception_time` column into distribution_queue table. [#46564](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46564) ([Aleksandr](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).
* Support for IN clause with parameter in parameterized views. [#46583](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46583) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Do not load named collections on server startup (load them on first access instead). [#46607](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46607) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

* Add an option for `clickhouse-watchdog` to restart the child process. This does not make a lot of use. [#46312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46312) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* If the environment variable `CLICKHOUSE_DOCKER_RESTART_ON_EXIT` is set to 1, the Docker container will run `clickhouse-server` as a child instead of the first process, and restart it when it exited. [#46391](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46391) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* When the callback in the cache is called, it is possible that this cache is destructed. To keep it safe, we capture members by value. It's also safe for task schedule because it will be deactivated before storage is destroyed. Resolve [#45548](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45548). [#45601](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45601) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).

* Should use `select_query_typed.limitByOffset()` instead of `select_query_typed.limitOffset()`. [#45817](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45817) ([刘陶峰](https://github.com/taofengliu)).
* When use experimental analyzer, queries like `SELECT number FROM numbers(100) LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;` get wrong results (empty result for this sql). That is caused by an unnecessary offset step added by planner. [#45822](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45822) ([刘陶峰](https://github.com/taofengliu)).
* Backward compatibility - allow implicit narrowing conversion from UInt64 to IPv4 - required for "INSERT ... VALUES ..." expression. [#45865](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45865) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).

* Add the `query_kind` column to the `system.processes` table and the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` query. Remove duplicate code. It fixes a bug: the global configuration parameter `max_concurrent_select_queries` was not respected to queries with `INTERSECT` or `EXCEPT` chains. [#45872](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45872) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### <a id="231"></a> ClickHouse release 23.1, 2023-01-26

### ClickHouse release 23.1

#### Upgrade Notes
* The `SYSTEM RESTART DISK` query becomes a no-op. [#44647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44647) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* The `PREALLOCATE` option for `HASHED`/`SPARSE_HASHED` dictionaries becomes a no-op. [#45388](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45388) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)). It does not give significant advantages anymore.
* Disallow `Gorilla` codec on columns of non-Float32 or non-Float64 type. [#45252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45252) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)). It was pointless and led to inconsistencies. 
* Parallel quorum inserts might work incorrectly with `*MergeTree` tables created with the deprecated syntax. Therefore, parallel quorum inserts support is completely disabled for such tables. It does not affect tables created with a new syntax. [#45430](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45430) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Use the `GetObjectAttributes` request instead of the `HeadObject` request to get the size of an object in AWS S3. This change fixes handling endpoints without explicit regions after updating the AWS SDK, for example. [#45288](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45288) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)). AWS S3 and Minio are tested, but keep in mind that various S3-compatible services (GCS, R2, B2) may have subtle incompatibilities. This change also may require you to adjust the ACL to allow the `GetObjectAttributes` request.
* Forbid paths in timezone names. For example, a timezone name like `/usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Aden` is not allowed; the IANA timezone database name like `Asia/Aden` should be used. [#44225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44225) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Queries combining equijoin and constant expressions (e.g., `JOIN ON t1.x = t2.x AND 1 = 1`) are forbidden due to incorrect results. [#44016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44016) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).


#### New Feature
* Dictionary source for extracting keys by traversing regular expressions tree. It can be used for User-Agent parsing. [#40878](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40878) ([Vage Ogannisian](https://github.com/nooblose)). [#43858](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43858) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).

* Array join support for the `Map` type, like the function "explode" in Spark. [#43239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43239) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Support SQL standard binary and hex string literals. [#43785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43785) ([Mo Xuan](https://github.com/mo-avatar)).
* Allow formatting `DateTime` in Joda-Time style. Refer to [the Joda-Time docs](https://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html). [#43818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43818) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Implemented a fractional second formatter (`%f`) for `formatDateTime`. [#44060](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44060) ([ltrk2](https://github.com/ltrk2)). [#44497](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44497) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Added `age` function to calculate the difference between two dates or dates with time values expressed as the number of full units. Closes [#41115](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41115). [#44421](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44421) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Add `Null` source for dictionaries. Closes [#44240](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44240). [#44502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44502) ([mayamika](https://github.com/mayamika)).
* Allow configuring the S3 storage class with the `s3_storage_class` configuration option. Such as `<s3_storage_class>STANDARD/INTELLIGENT_TIERING</s3_storage_class>` Closes [#44443](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44443). [#44707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44707) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Insert default values in case of missing elements in JSON object while parsing named tuple. Add setting `input_format_json_defaults_for_missing_elements_in_named_tuple` that controls this behaviour. Closes [#45142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45142)#issuecomment-1380153217. [#45231](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45231) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Record server startup time in ProfileEvents (`ServerStartupMilliseconds`). Resolves [#43188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43188). [#45250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45250) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Refactor and Improve streaming engines Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS and add support for all formats, also refactor formats a bit: - Fix producing messages in row-based formats with suffixes/prefixes. Now every message is formatted completely with all delimiters and can be parsed back using input format. - Support block-based formats like Native, Parquet, ORC, etc. Every block is formatted as a separate message. The number of rows in one message depends on the block size, so you can control it via the setting `max_block_size`. - Add new engine settings `kafka_max_rows_per_message/rabbitmq_max_rows_per_message/nats_max_rows_per_message`. They control the number of rows formatted in one message in row-based formats. Default value: 1. - Fix high memory consumption in the NATS table engine. - Support arbitrary binary data in NATS producer (previously it worked only with strings contained \0 at the end) - Add missing Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS engine settings in the documentation. - Refactor producing and consuming in Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS, separate it from WriteBuffers/ReadBuffers semantic. - Refactor output formats: remove callbacks on each row used in Kafka/RabbitMQ/NATS (now we don't use callbacks there), allow to use IRowOutputFormat directly, clarify row end and row between delimiters, make it possible to reset output format to start formatting again - Add proper implementation in formatRow function (bonus after formats refactoring). [#42777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42777) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support reading/writing `Nested` tables as `List` of `Struct` in `CapnProto` format. Read/write `Decimal32/64` as `Int32/64`. Closes [#43319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43319). [#43379](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43379) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Added a `message_format_string` column to `system.text_log`. The column contains a pattern that was used to format the message. [#44543](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44543) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)). This allows various analytics over the ClickHouse logs.
* Try to autodetect headers with column names (and maybe types) for CSV/TSV/CustomSeparated input formats.
Add settings input_format_tsv/csv/custom_detect_header that enable this behaviour (enabled by default). Closes [#44640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44640). [#44953](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44953) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Add an experimental inverted index as a new secondary index type for efficient text search. [#38667](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38667) ([larryluogit](https://github.com/larryluogit)).
* Add experimental query result cache. [#43797](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43797) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Added extendable and configurable scheduling subsystem for IO requests (not yet integrated with IO code itself). [#41840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41840) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)). This feature does nothing at all, enjoy.
* Added `SYSTEM DROP DATABASE REPLICA` that removes metadata of a dead replica of a `Replicated` database. Resolves [#41794](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41794). [#42807](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42807) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Do not load inactive parts at startup of `MergeTree` tables. [#42181](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42181) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improved latency of reading from storage `S3` and table function `s3` with large numbers of small files. Now settings `remote_filesystem_read_method` and `remote_filesystem_read_prefetch` take effect while reading from storage `S3`. [#43726](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43726) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Optimization for reading struct fields in Parquet/ORC files. Only the required fields are loaded. [#44484](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44484) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Two-level aggregation algorithm was mistakenly disabled for queries over the HTTP interface. It was enabled back, and it leads to a major performance improvement. [#45450](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45450) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Added mmap support for StorageFile, which should improve the performance of clickhouse-local. [#43927](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43927) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Added sharding support in HashedDictionary to allow parallel load (almost linear scaling based on number of shards). [#40003](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40003) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Speed up query parsing. [#42284](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42284) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Always replace OR chain `expr = x1 OR ... OR expr = xN` to `expr IN (x1, ..., xN)` in the case where `expr` is a `LowCardinality` column. Setting `optimize_min_equality_disjunction_chain_length` is ignored in this case. [#42889](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42889) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).
* Slightly improve performance by optimizing the code around ThreadStatus. [#43586](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43586) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Optimize the column-wise ternary logic evaluation by achieving auto-vectorization. In the performance test of this [microbenchmark](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh/ClickHouse/blob/20221123-ternary-logic-opt-example/src/Functions/examples/associative_applier_perf.cpp), we've observed a peak **performance gain** of **21x** on the ICX device (Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 CPU). [#43669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43669) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Avoid acquiring read locks in the `system.tables` table if possible. [#43840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43840) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Optimize ThreadPool. The performance experiments of SSB (Star Schema Benchmark) on the ICX device (Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 CPU, 80 cores, 160 threads) shows that this change could effectively decrease the lock contention for ThreadPoolImpl::mutex by **75%**, increasing the CPU utilization and improving the overall performance by **2.4%**. [#44308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44308) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Now the optimisation for predicting the hash table size is applied only if the cached hash table size is sufficiently large (thresholds were determined empirically and hardcoded). [#44455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44455) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Small performance improvement for asynchronous reading from remote filesystems. [#44868](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44868) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add fast path for: - `col like '%%'`; - `col like '%'`; - `col not like '%'`; - `col not like '%'`; - `match(col, '.*')`. [#45244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45244) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Slightly improve happy path optimisation in filtering (WHERE clause). [#45289](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45289) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Provide monotonicity info for `toUnixTimestamp64*` to enable more algebraic optimizations for index analysis. [#44116](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44116) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Allow the configuration of temporary data for query processing (spilling to disk) to cooperate with the filesystem cache (taking up the space from the cache disk) [#43972](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43972) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)). This mainly improves [ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.cloud/), but can be used for self-managed setups as well, if you know what to do.
* Make `system.replicas` table do parallel fetches of replicas statuses. Closes [#43918](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43918). [#43998](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43998) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Optimize memory consumption during backup to S3: files to S3 now will be copied directly without using `WriteBufferFromS3` (which could use a lot of memory). [#45188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45188) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add a cache for async block ids. This will reduce the number of requests of ZooKeeper when we enable async inserts deduplication. [#45106](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45106) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).

#### Improvement

* Allow to implicitly convert floats stored in string fields of JSON to integers in `JSONExtract` functions. E.g. `JSONExtract('{"a": "1000.111"}', 'a', 'UInt64')` -> `1000`, previously it returned 0. [#45432](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45432) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Added fields `supports_parallel_parsing` and `supports_parallel_formatting` to table `system.formats` for better introspection. [#45499](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45499) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

* Unify query elapsed time measurements. [#43455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43455) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improve automatic usage of structure from insertion table in table functions file/hdfs/s3 when virtual columns are present in a select query, it fixes the possible error `Block structure mismatch` or `number of columns mismatch`. [#43695](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43695) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add support for signed arguments in the function `range`. Fixes [#43333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43333). [#43733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43733) ([sanyu](https://github.com/wineternity)).
* Remove redundant sorting, for example, sorting related ORDER BY clauses in subqueries. Implemented on top of query plan. It does similar optimization as `optimize_duplicate_order_by_and_distinct` regarding `ORDER BY` clauses, but more generic, since it's applied to any redundant sorting steps (not only caused by ORDER BY clause) and applied to subqueries of any depth. Related to [#42648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42648). [#43905](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43905) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Add the ability to disable deduplication of files for BACKUP (for backups without deduplication ATTACH can be used instead of full RESTORE). For example `BACKUP foo TO S3(...) SETTINGS deduplicate_files=0` (default `deduplicate_files=1`). [#43947](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43947) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Refactor and improve schema inference for text formats. Add new setting `schema_inference_make_columns_nullable` that controls making result types `Nullable` (enabled by default);. [#44019](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44019) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Better support for `PROXYv1` protocol. [#44135](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44135) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Add information about the latest part check by cleanup threads into `system.parts` table. [#44244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44244) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Disable table functions in readonly mode for inserts. [#44290](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44290) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add a setting `simultaneous_parts_removal_limit` to allow limiting the number of parts being processed by one iteration of CleanupThread. [#44461](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44461) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Do not initialize ReadBufferFromS3 when only virtual columns are needed in a query. This may be helpful to [#44246](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44246). [#44493](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44493) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).

* Add a user-level setting `database_replicated_allow_replicated_engine_arguments` which allows banning the creation of `ReplicatedMergeTree` tables with arguments in `DatabaseReplicated`. [#44566](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44566) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Prevent users from mistakenly specifying zero (invalid) value for `index_granularity`. This closes [#44536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44536). [#44578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44578) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added possibility to set path to service keytab file in `keytab` parameter in `kerberos` section of config.xml. [#44594](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44594) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* Use already written part of the query for fuzzy search (pass to the `skim` library, which is written in Rust and linked statically to ClickHouse). [#44600](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44600) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Enable `input_format_json_read_objects_as_strings` by default to be able to read nested JSON objects while JSON Object type is experimental. [#44657](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44657) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Improvement for deduplication of async inserts: when users do duplicate async inserts, we should deduplicate inside the memory before we query Keeper. [#44682](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44682) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Input/ouptut `Avro` format will parse bool type as ClickHouse bool type. [#44684](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44684) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support Bool type in Arrow/Parquet/ORC. Closes [#43970](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43970). [#44698](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44698) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Don't greedily parse beyond the quotes when reading UUIDs - it may lead to mistakenly successful parsing of incorrect data. [#44686](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44686) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Infer UInt64 in case of Int64 overflow and fix some transforms in schema inference. [#44696](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44696) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Previously dependency resolving inside `Replicated` database was done in a hacky way, and now it's done right using an explicit graph. [#44697](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44697) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Fix `output_format_pretty_row_numbers` does not preserve the counter across the blocks. Closes [#44815](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44815). [#44832](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44832) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).

* Optimize and fix metrics for Distributed async INSERT. [#44922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44922) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added settings to disallow concurrent backups and restores resolves [#43891](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43891) Implementation: * Added server-level settings to disallow concurrent backups and restores, which are read and set when BackupWorker is created in Context. * Settings are set to true by default. * Before starting backup or restores, added a check to see if any other backups/restores are running. For internal requests, it checks if it is from the self node using backup_uuid. [#45072](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45072) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add `<storage_policy>` config parameter for system logs. [#45320](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45320) ([Stig Bakken](https://github.com/stigsb)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Statically link with the `skim` library (it is written in Rust) for fuzzy search in clickhouse client/local history. [#44239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44239) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* We removed support for shared linking because of Rust. Actually, Rust is only an excuse for this removal, and we wanted to remove it nevertheless. [#44828](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44828) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove the dependency on the `adduser` tool from the packages, because we don't use it. This fixes [#44934](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44934). [#45011](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/45011) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fix possible too early cache write interruption in write-through cache (caching could be stopped due to false assumption when it shouldn't have). [#44289](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44289) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fix possible crash in the case function `IN` with constant arguments was used as a constant argument together with `LowCardinality`. Fixes [#44221](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44221). [#44346](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44346) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Fix support for complex parameters (like arrays) of parametric aggregate functions. This closes [#30975](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/30975). The aggregate function `sumMapFiltered` was unusable in distributed queries before this change. [#44358](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44358) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

Closes [#44333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44333). [#44405](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44405) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Previously the `bar` function used the same '▋' (U+258B "Left five eighths block") character to display both 5/8 and 6/8 bars. This change corrects this behavior by using '▊' (U+258A "Left three quarters block") for displaying 6/8 bar. [#44410](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44410) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).

[#44781](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44781) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* A rare race condition was possible when querying the `system.parts` or `system.parts_columns` tables in the presence of parts being moved between disks. Introduced in [#41145](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41145). [#44809](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44809) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Delay for INSERT can be calculated incorrectly, which can lead to always using `max_delay_to_insert` setting as delay instead of a correct value. Using simple formula `max_delay_to_insert * (parts_over_threshold/max_allowed_parts_over_threshold)` i.e. delay grows proportionally to parts over threshold. Closes [#44902](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44902). [#44954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44954) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
