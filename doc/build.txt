# How to build ClickHouse
#
# Build should work on Linux Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 or newer.
# With appropriate changes, build should work on any other Linux distribution.
# Build is not intended to work on Mac OS X.
# Only x86_64 is supported. Support for AArch64 is experimental.

sudo apt-get install git cmake

# Install GCC 5.
# There are several ways to do it.
#
# 1. If you run on Ubuntu 15.10 or newer, just do
# sudo apt-get install g++-5
#
# 2. Install from PPA package.

sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-5 g++-5

export THREADS=$(grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo)

# 3. Install GCC 5 from sources.
#
# Download gcc from https://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html
# Example:
# wget ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/languages/gcc/releases/gcc-5.3.0/gcc-5.3.0.tar.bz2
# tar xf gcc-5.3.0.tar.bz2
# cd gcc-5.3.0
# ./contrib/download_prerequisites
# cd ..
# mkdir gcc-build
# cd gcc-build
# ../gcc-5.3.0/configure --enable-languages=c,c++
# make -j $THREADS
# sudo make install
# hash gcc g++
# gcc --version
# sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc /usr/local/bin/gcc-5
# sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/g++ /usr/local/bin/g++-5
# sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/cc /usr/local/bin/gcc-5
# sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/c++ /usr/local/bin/g++-5
# /usr/local/bin/ should be in $PATH
#
# Note that these ways of installation differs.
# When installing from PPA, by default, "old C++ ABI" is used,
#  and when installing from sources, "new C++ ABI" is used.
# When using different C++ ABI, you need to recompile all C++ libraries,
#  otherwise libraries will not link.
# ClickHouse works with both old and new C++ ABI,
#  but production releases is built with old C++ ABI.

export CC=gcc-5
export CXX=g++-5

# Install required libraries from packages

sudo apt-get install libicu-dev libglib2.0-dev libreadline-dev libzookeeper-mt-dev libmysqlclient-dev libssl-dev unixodbc-dev

# Install recent version of boost. Version 1.57 or newer will be Ok.

wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.60.0/boost_1_60_0.tar.bz2
tar xf boost_1_60_0.tar.bz2
cd boost_1_60_0
./bootstrap.sh
./b2 --toolset=gcc-5 -j $THREADS
sudo ./b2 install --toolset=gcc-5 -j $THREADS
cd ..

# Install mongoclient. This library is needed only for 'external dictionaries' with MongoDB source.
# This is rarely used but enabled by default.
# If you don't need it, you could set variable and skip installation step:
# export DISABLE_MONGODB=1

sudo apt-get install scons
git clone -b legacy https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver.git
cd mongo-cxx-driver
sudo scons --c++11 --release --cc=$CC --cxx=$CXX --disable-warnings-as-errors -j $THREADS --prefix=/usr/local install
cd ..

# Checkout ClickHouse sources.

git clone git@github.com:yandex/ClickHouse.git
# or: git clone https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse.git

cd ClickHouse

# There are two variants of build.
# 1. Build release package.

# Install prerequisites to build debian packages.
sudo apt-get install devscripts dupload fakeroot debhelper

# Install recent version of clang. Clang is embedded into ClickHouse package and used at runtime. It is optional.

cd ..
sudo apt-get install subversion
mkdir llvm
cd llvm
svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/tags/RELEASE_380/final llvm
cd llvm/tools
svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/tags/RELEASE_380/final clang
cd ..
cd projects/
svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/tags/RELEASE_380/final compiler-rt
cd ../..
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ../llvm
make -j $THREADS
sudo make install
hash clang

# You may also build ClickHouse with clang for development purposes.
# For production releases, GCC is used.

# Run release script.
rm -f ../clickhouse*.deb
./release

# debsign and dupload will not work by default.
# It's Ok. You will find built packages in parent directory.
# ls -l ../clickhouse*.deb

# Note that usage of debian packages is not required.
# ClickHouse has no runtime dependencies except libc,
# so it could work on almost any Linux.

# Installing just built packages on development server.
sudo dpkg -i ../clickhouse*.deb
sudo service clickhouse-server start

# 2. Build to work with code.
#
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
# make -j $THREADS
# cd ..
