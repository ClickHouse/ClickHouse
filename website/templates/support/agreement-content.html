    		<p>2.2 <u>Order for Support Services Subscriptions.</u> Orders for Subscriptions may be placed by Customer through (1) the execution of Order Forms with ClickHouse or (2) issuance by Customer of a Qualifying PO, which will be deemed to constitute, for the purposes of this Agreement, the execution by Customer of the referenced Order Form.</p>

    		<p>2.3 <u>Affiliates.</u> The parties agree that their respective Affiliates may also conduct business under this Agreement by entering into Order Forms, which in some cases may be subject to such additional and/or alternative terms and conditions to those contained in this Agreement as may be mutually agreed in the Order Form or an attachment thereto, as applicable. Accordingly, where Affiliates of the parties conduct business hereunder, references to Customer herein shall include any applicable Customer Affiliate, and references to ClickHouse herein shall include any applicable ClickHouse Affiliate.

    		<p>3.1 <u>Payment.</u> ClickHouse will invoice Customer for the fees due under each Order Form or otherwise under this Agreement, and Customer will pay such fees within thirty (30) days after receipt of an applicable invoice. All invoices will be paid in the currency set forth on the applicable Order Form. Payments will be made without right of set-off or chargeback.

Taxes do not include any taxes on the net income of ClickHouse or any of its Affiliates. Unless Customer provides ClickHouse a valid state sales/use/excise tax exemption certificate or Direct Pay Permit, and provided that ClickHouse separately states any such taxes in the applicable invoice, Customer will pay and be solely responsible for all Taxes. If Customer is required by any foreign governmental authority to deduct or withhold any portion of the amount invoiced for the delivery or use of Support Services under this Agreement, Customer shall increase the sum paid to ClickHouse by an amount necessary for the total payment to ClickHouse equal to the amount originally invoiced.</p>

			</ol>

			<p>8.9 <u>Non-waiver.</u> Any failure of either party to insist upon or enforce performance by the other party of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or remedies under this Agreement will not be interpreted or construed as a waiver or relinquishment of such party's right to assert or rely upon such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance.</p>

			<p>8.10 <u>Notices.</u> Any notice or other communication under this Agreement given by either party to the other will be deemed to be properly given if given in writing and delivered in person or by e-mail, if acknowledged received by return e-mail or followed within one day by a delivered or mailed copy of such notice, or if mailed, properly addressed and stamped with the required postage, to the intended recipient at its address specified on an Order Form.

			<p>8.13 <u>Entire Agreement; Amendment.</u> This Agreement, together with any Order Forms executed by the parties, and the Support Services Policy, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by this reference, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and it supersedes, and its terms govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Execution of a scanned copy will have the same force and effect as execution of an original, and a scanned signature will be deemed an original and valid signature. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of any of the foregoing documents, the conflict shall be resolved based on the following order of precedence: (i) an applicable Order Form (but only for the transaction thereunder), (ii) an applicable Addendum (including any exhibits, attachments and addenda thereto), (iii) this Agreement, and (iv) the Support Services Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that if Customer issues any purchase orders or similar documents in connection with its purchase of a Subscription, it shall do so only for the purpose of Section 2.2(2) or for its own internal, administrative purposes and not with the intent to provide any contractual terms. By entering into this Agreement, whether prior to or following receipt of Customer's purchase order or any similar document, the parties are hereby expressly showing their intention not to be contractually bound by the contents of any such purchase order or similar document, which are hereby deemed rejected and extraneous to this Agreement, and ClickHouse's performance of this Agreement shall not amount to: (i) an acceptance by conduct of any terms set out or referred to in the purchase order or similar document; (ii) an amendment of this Agreement, nor (iii) an agreement to amend this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be modified except by a subsequently dated, written amendment that expressly amends this Agreement and which is signed on behalf of ClickHouse and Customer by their duly authorized representatives. The parties agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are a result of mutual negotiations. Therefore, the rule of construction that any ambiguity shall apply against the drafter is not applicable and will not apply to this Agreement. Any ambiguity shall be reasonably construed as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against one party regardless of who authored the ambiguous language.</p>
