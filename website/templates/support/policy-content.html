    				<p class="mt-2"><strong>Severity Level 1</strong></p>
    				<p>A Severity Level 1 issue is a major production error within the software that severely impacts the Customer's use of the software for production purposes, such as the loss of production data or where production systems are not functioning and no work-around exists. ClickHouse will use continuous efforts during applicable Normal Business Hours to provide a resolution for any Level 1 issues as soon as is commercially reasonable.</p>
    				<p><strong>Severity Level 2</strong></p>
    				<p>A Severity Level 2 issue is an error within the software where the customer's system is functioning for production purposes but in a reduced capacity, such as a problem that is causing significant impact to portions of the customer's business operations and productivity, or where the software is exposed to potential loss or interruption of service. ClickHouse will use continuous efforts during the Normal Business Hours to provide a resolution for any Severity Level 2 issues.</p>
    				<p><strong>Severity Level 3</strong></p>
    				<p>A Severity Level 3 issue is a medium-to-low impact error that involves partial and/or non-critical loss of functionality for production purposes or development purposes, such as a problem that impairs some operations but allows the customer's operations to continue to function. Errors for which there is limited or no loss or functionality or impact to the customer's operation and for which there is an easy work-around qualify as Severity Level 3. General questions are also Severity Level issues.  ClickHouse will use reasonable efforts to provide a resolution for any Severity Level 3 issues in time for an upcoming release of the software. All inbound production email cases shall have an initial status of Severity Level 3.</p>
    			</li>
    			<li><strong>Customer Obligations.</strong>
    				<p class="mt-2">Customer agrees to provide ClickHouse with reasonable: (i) detail of the nature of and circumstances surrounding the issue, (ii) access to Customer's environment as necessary to enable ClickHouse to provide Support Services; and (iii) cooperation in the diagnosis and resolution of any issues.</p>
    			</li>
    			<li><strong>Supported Versions.</strong>
    				<p class="mt-2">Notwithstanding anything else, ClickHouse will support the current Regular Stable Release in conjunction with the two (2) prior Regular Stable Releases of the Software or a minimum period of three (3) months from the date of the current Regular Stable Release. ClickHouse will support the current Long-Term Supported Release in conjunction with the one (1) prior Long-Term Supported Release of the Software or a minimum period of one (1) year from the date of the current Long-Term Supported Release. </p>

    			</li>
    			<li><strong>Support Service Exclusions.</strong>
    				<p class="mt-2">ClickHouse will have no obligation to provide Support Services to Customer in the event that (i) the Software has been changed, modified or damaged by Customer or anyone other than ClickHouse, (ii) the problem is caused by Customer's negligence, misconduct, or misuse of the Software, a hardware malfunction, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of ClickHouse, (iii) the problem is due to third party software, (iv) the Software is being hosted by a third party that is offering the Software as a service (v) Customer has not installed or implemented any Software releases made generally available or is not running a then supported version of the Software as provided by ClickHouse or (vi) information requested by Customer could reasonably be expected to assist in the development, deployment, enablement and/or maintenance of any non-ClickHouse software that competes with ClickHouse's commercial software products.
