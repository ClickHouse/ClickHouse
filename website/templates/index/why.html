                <p>ClickHouse uses all available hardware to its full potential to process each query as fast as possible. Peak
            processing performance for a single query stands at more than 2&nbsp;terabytes per second <span class="text-muted">(after decompression, only used columns)</span>. In distributed setup  reads are automatically balanced among healthy replicas to avoid increasing latency.</p>

                <h3 id="fault-tolerant" class="display-5">Fault-tolerant</h3>
                <p>ClickHouse supports multi-master asynchronous replication and can be deployed across multiple datacenters. All nodes are equal, which allows avoiding having single points of failure. Downtime of a single node or the whole datacenter won't affect the system's availability for both reads and writes.</p>
