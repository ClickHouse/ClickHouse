                <p>ClickHouse uses all available hardware to its full potential to process each query as fast as possible. Peak
            processing performance for a single query stands at more than 2&nbsp;terabytes per second <span class="text-muted">(after decompression, only used columns)</span>. In distributed setup  reads are automatically balanced among healthy replicas to avoid increasing latency.</p>

                <p>ClickHouse supports multi-master asynchronous replication and can be deployed across multiple datacenters. All nodes are equal, which allows avoiding having single points of failure. Downtime of a single node or the whole datacenter won't affect the system's availability for both reads and writes.</p>

                <p>ClickHouse scales well both vertically and horizontally. ClickHouse is easily adaptable to perform either on a cluster with hundreds or thousands of nodes or on a single server or even on a tiny virtual machine. Currently, there are installations with more multiple trillion rows or hundreds of terabytes of data per single node.</p>
