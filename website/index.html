        <p>ClickHouse allows companies to add servers to their clusters when necessary without investing time or money into
            any additional DBMS modification. The system has been successfully serving
            <a href="https://metrica.yandex.com/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Yandex.Metrica</a>,
            while the count of servers in it's main production cluster have grown from 60 to 394 in two years,
            which are by the way located in six geographically distributed datacenters.</p>

        <p>ClickHouse scales well both vertically and horizontally. ClickHouse is easily adaptable to perform either on
            cluster with hundreds of nodes, or on a single server or even on a tiny virtual machine. Currently there are
            installations with more than two trillion rows per single node,
            as well as installations with 100Tb of storage per single node.</p>

        <h2 id="fault-tolerant" class="mt-5">Fault tolerant</h2>

        <p>ClickHouse supports multi-master asynchronous replication and can be deployed across multiple datacenters.
            Downtime of a single node or the whole datacenter won't affect the system's availability for both reads and
            writes.
            Distributed reads are automatically balanced to live replicas to avoid increasing latency. Replicated data
            are synchronized automatically or semi-automatically after server downtime.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Simple and handy</h2>
        <p>ClickHouse streamlines all your data processing. It's easy to use: ingest all your structured data into the
            system, and it&nbsp;is instantly available for reports. New columns for new properties or dimensions can be
            easily added to the system at any time without slowing it&nbsp;down.</p>

        <p>ClickHouse is simple and works out-of-the-box. As well as performing on hundreds of node clusters, this system
            can be easily installed on a single server or even a virtual machine. No development experience or code-writing
            skills are required to install ClickHouse.</p>

        <h2 id="feature-rich" class="mt-5">Feature rich</h2>

        <p>ClickHouse features a user-friendly SQL query dialect with a number of built-in analytics capabilities.
            For example, it includes probabilistic data
            structures for fast and memory-efficient calculation of cardinalities and quantiles. There are functions for
            working dates, times and time zones, as well as some specialized ones like addressing URLs and IPs
            (both IPv4 and IPv6) and many more.</p>

        <p>Data organizing options available in ClickHouse, such as arrays, array joins, tuples and nested data structures, are
            extremely efficient for managing denormalized data.</p>

        <p>Using ClickHouse allows joining both distributed data and co-located data, as the system supports local joins and
            distributed joins. It&nbsp;also offers an opportunity to use external dictionaries, dimension tables loaded from
            an external source, for seamless joins with simple syntax.</p>

        <p>ClickHouse supports approximate query processing – you can get results as fast as you want, which is
            indispensable when dealing with terabytes and petabytes of data.</p>

        <p>The system's conditional aggregate functions, calculation of totals and extremes, allow getting results with a
            single query without having to run a number of them.</p>

        <p>ClickHouse has been managing petabytes of data serving a number of highload mass audience services of
            <a href="https://www.yandex.com/company/"
               rel="external nofollow">Yandex</a>, Russia's
            leading search provider and one of largest European IT companies.
            Since 2012, ClickHouse has been providing robust database management for the company's <a
                    href="https://metrica.yandex.com/" rel="external nofollow">web analytics service</a>, comparison
            e-commerce platform, public email service, online advertising platform, business intelligence tools
            and infrastructure monitoring.</p>

        <p>ClickHouse can be configured as purely distributed system located on independent nodes,
            without any single points of failure.</p>

        <p>Software and hardware failures or misconfigurations do not result in loss of data. Instead of deleting "broken"
            data, ClickHouse saves it&nbsp;or asks you what to do before a startup. All data is checksummed before every
            read or write to disk or network. It&nbsp;is virtually impossible to delete data by accident as there are safeguards
            even for human errors.</p>

        <p>ClickHouse offers flexible limits on query complexity and resource usage, which can be fine-tuned with settings.
            It&nbsp;is possible to simultaneously serve both a number of high priority low-latency requests and some
            long-running queries with background priority.</p>
