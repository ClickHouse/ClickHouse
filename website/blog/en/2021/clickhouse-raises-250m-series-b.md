Today, we are excited to announce that ClickHouse has raised $250 million in Series B funding at a $2B valuation. The round was led by Coatue and Altimeter, with participation from existing investors Index, Benchmark, Yandex, Almaz, and Lead Edge alongside new investors Lightspeed, Redpoint, and FirstMark. We are thrilled to partner with such an accomplished group. Not only is it a testament to the disruptive potential of our technology and our momentum to date, but more importantly, it’s an aggressive investment in our future. This funding will enable ClickHouse to grow our team, scale the product, and continue building a world-class, commercial-grade cloud solution that’s secure, compliant, and convenient for any customer to use. (You can read more about the funding round in our press release [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211028005287/en)). 

For the past five years, ClickHouse thrived as a popular open-source product— with a dedicated user community. ClickHouse thrived for a simple reason—we deliver high query processing speed and data storage efficiency that is unmatched. ClickHouse is capable of processing 100+ PBs of data with more than 100 billion records inserted every day. It is 100-1000X faster than traditional approaches and this speed and efficiency has attracted customers that are household names. The commercial potential for the product was clear - and in September 2021, we decided to combine resources and officially incorporate as a company. We took the team of core ClickHouse developers led by ClickHouse creator [Alexey Milovidov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexey-milovidov-7b658135/) and brought in a world-class business team led by [Aaron Katz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-katz-5762094/) and a cloud engineering team led by [Yury Izrailevsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuryizrailevsky/).

Fueled by this large investment, we are hiring. We plan to double our team this year, and double it again next year. We are calling on all visionaries, builders, and contributors to join us as we build ClickHouse into a transformative, paradigm-shifting company. Our mission is to become the first choice of analytical database management systems. We are relentlessly focused on building an enterprise-grade, highly secure, and fault tolerant, multi-tenant service in the cloud that is accessible to organizations across sizes and sectors. 

If this sounds like something you want to be a part of, now’s the time to join us. To learn more about the positions we are hiring for, and what we are looking for in new hires, visit [clickhouse.com/careers](/careers/).
