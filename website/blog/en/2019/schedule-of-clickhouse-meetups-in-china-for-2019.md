Last year there were two ClickHouse Meetups in Beijing, in [January](../2018/clickhouse-community-meetup-in-beijing-on-january-27-2018.md) and [October](../2018/clickhouse-community-meetup-in-beijing-on-january-27-2018.md), and they appeared to be in extremely high demand, with fully packed venue and thousands of people watching online. So this year we decided to try to expand meetups to other large cities in China where we see the most interest in ClickHouse based on website visits. Here's the current schedule and sign up pages:

-   [ClickHouse Community Meetup in Beijing](https://www.huodongxing.com/event/2483759276200) on June 8.
-   [ClickHouse Community Meetup in Shenzhen](https://www.huodongxing.com/event/3483759917300) on October 20.
-   [ClickHouse Community Meetup in Shanghai](https://www.huodongxing.com/event/4483760336000) on October 27.
