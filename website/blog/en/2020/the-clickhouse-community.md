One of the great “features” of ClickHouse is a friendly and welcoming community. In this article we would like to outline how the ClickHouse community arose, what it is today, and how you can get involved. There is a role for everyone, from end users to contributors to corporate friends. Our goal is to make the community welcoming to every person who wants to join.

But first, let’s review a bit of history, starting with how ClickHouse first developed at [Yandex](https://yandex.com/company/).

## Origins at Yandex

ClickHouse began as a solution for web analytics in [Yandex Metrica](https://metrica.yandex.com/about?). Metrica is a popular service for analyzing website traffic that is now #2 in the market behind Google Analytics. In 2008 [Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov), an engineer on the Metrica team, was looking for a database that could create reports on metrics like number of page views per day, unique visitors, and bounce rate, without aggregating the data in advance. The idea was to provide a wide range of metric data and let users ask any question about them.

This is a classic problem for data warehouses. However, Alexey could not find one that met Yandex requirements, specifically large datasets, linear scaling, high efficiency, and compatibility with SQL tools. In a nutshell: like MySQL but for analytic applications. So Alexey wrote one. It started as a prototype to do GROUP BY operations.

The prototype evolved into a full solution with a name, ClickHouse, short for “Clickstream Data Warehouse”. Alexey added additional features including SQL support and the MergeTree engine. The SQL dialect was superficially similar to MySQL, [which was also used in Metrica](https://clickhouse.tech/blog/en/2016/evolution-of-data-structures-in-yandex-metrica/) but could not handle query workloads without complex pre-aggregation. By 2011 ClickHouse was in production for Metrica.

Over the next 5 years Alexey and a growing team of developers extended ClickHouse to cover new use cases. By 2016 ClickHouse was a core Metrica backend service. It was also becoming entrenched as a data warehouse within Yandex, extending to use cases like service monitoring, network flow logs, and event management. ClickHouse had evolved from the original one-person project to business critical software with a full team of a dozen engineers led by Alexey.

By 2016, ClickHouse had an 8 year history and was ready to become a major open source project.  Here’s a timeline that tracks major developments as a time series.

## ClickHouse goes open source

Yandex open sourced ClickHouse under an Apache 2.0 license in 2016. There were numerous reasons for this step.

* Promote adoption within Yandex by making it easier for internal departments to get builds.
* Ensure that ClickHouse would continue to evolve by creating a community to nurture it.
* Motivate developers to contribute to and use ClickHouse due to the open source “cool” factor.
* Improve ClickHouse quality by making the code public. Nobody wants their name visible on bad code. ;-)
* Showcase Yandex innovation to a worldwide audience.

Alexey and the development team moved ClickHouse code to a Github repo under the Yandex organization and began issuing community builds as well as accepting external contributions. They simultaneously began regular meetups to popularize ClickHouse and build a community around it. The result was a burst of adoption across multiple regions of the globe.

ClickHouse quickly picked up steam in Eastern Europe. The first ClickHouse meetups started in 2016 and have grown to include 200 participants for in-person meetings and up to 400 for online meetings.  ClickHouse is now widely used in start-ups in Russia as well as other Eastern European countries. Developers located in Eastern Europe continue to supply more contributions to ClickHouse than any other region.

ClickHouse also started to gain recognition in the US and Western Europe. [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) published a widely read blog article about [their success using ClickHouse for DNS analytics](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-analyzes-1m-dns-queries-per-second/). Alexander Zaitsev successfully migrated an ad tech analytics system from a commercial DBMS to a ClickHouse cluster. This success prompted him to found [Altinity](https://altinity.com) in 2017 with help from friends at [Percona](https://www.percona.com). US meetups started in the same year. With support from Altinity these have grown to over 100 attendees for online meetings.

ClickHouse also took off in China. The first meetup in China took place in 2018 and attracted enormous interest. In-person meetups included over 400 participants.  Online meetings have reached up to 1000 online viewers.

In 2019 a further step occurred as ClickHouse moved out from under the Yandex Github organization into a separate [ClickHouse organization](https://github.com/ClickHouse). The new organization includes ClickHouse server code plus core ecosystem projects like the cpp and ODBC drivers.

ClickHouse community events shifted online following world-wide disruptions due to COVID-19, but growth in usage continued. One interesting development has been the increasing number of startups using ClickHouse as a backend. Many of these are listed on the [ClickHouse Adopters](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/introduction/adopters/) page. Also, additional prominent companies like eBay, Uber, and Flipcart went public in 2020 with stories of successful ClickHouse usage.

## The ClickHouse community today

As of 2020 the ClickHouse community includes developers and users from virtually every region of the globe. Yandex engineers continue to supply a majority of pull requests to ClickHouse itself. Altinity follows in second place with contributions to ClickHouse core and ecosystem projects. There is also substantial in-house development on ClickHouse (e.g. on private forks) within Chinese internet providers.

The real success, however, has been the huge number of commits to ClickHouse core from people in outside organizations. The following list shows the main outside contributors:
