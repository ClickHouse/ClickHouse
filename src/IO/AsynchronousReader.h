/** Interface for asynchronous reads from file descriptors.
  * It can abstract Linux AIO, io_uring or normal reads from separate thread pool,
  * and also reads from non-local filesystems.
  * The implementation not necessarily to be efficient for large number of small requests,
  * instead it should be ok for moderate number of sufficiently large requests
  * (e.g. read 1 MB of data 50 000 times per seconds; BTW this is normal performance for reading from page cache).
  * For example, this interface may not suffice if you want to serve 10 000 000 of 4 KiB requests per second.
  * This interface is fairly limited.
