/** Base class for ReadBuffer and WriteBuffer.
  * Contains common types, variables, and functions.
  *
  * ReadBuffer and WriteBuffer are similar to istream and ostream, respectively.
  * They have to be used, because using iostreams it is impossible to effectively implement some operations.
  * For example, using istream, you can not quickly read string values from a tab-separated file,
  *  so that after reading, the position remains immediately after the read value.
  * (The only option is to call the std::istream::get() function on each byte, but this slows down due to several virtual calls.)
  *
  * Read/WriteBuffers provide direct access to the internal buffer, so the necessary operations are implemented more efficiently.
  * Only one virtual function nextImpl() is used, which is rarely called:
  * - in the case of ReadBuffer - fill in the buffer with new data from the source;
  * - in the case of WriteBuffer - write data from the buffer into the receiver.
  *
  * Read/WriteBuffer can own or not own an own piece of memory.
  * In the second case, you can effectively read from an already existing piece of memory / std::string without copying it.
