/*
 * Helper class to keep track of requested and consumed amount of resource.
 * Useful if real amount of consumed resource can differ from requested amount of resource (e.g. in case of failures).
 * Can be safely used from multiple threads.
 * Usage example:
 *     ResourceBudget budget;
 *     while (!stop) {
 *         ResourceCost est_cost = myEstimateOfCostOrJustUseOne();
 *         myAllocateResource(budget.ask(est_cost)); // Ask external system to allocate resource for you
 *         ResourceCost real_cost = mySynchronousConsumptionOfResource(); // Real consumption can differ from est_cost
 *         budget.adjust(est_cost, real_cost); // Adjust balance according to the actual cost, may affect the next iteration
 *     }
