/** A simple abstract class for buffered data reading (char sequences) from somewhere.
  * Unlike std::istream, it provides access to the internal buffer,
  *  and also allows you to manually manage the position inside the buffer.
  *
  * Note! `char *`, not `const char *` is used
  *  (so that you can take out the common code into BufferBase, and also so that you can fill the buffer in with new data).
  * This causes inconveniences - for example, when using ReadBuffer to read from a chunk of memory const char *,
  *  you have to use const_cast.
  *
  * Derived classes must implement the nextImpl() method.
