    /** This codec encrypts and decrypts blocks with AES-128 in
      * GCM-SIV mode (RFC-8452), which is the only cipher currently
      * supported. Although it is implemented as a compression codec
      * it doesn't actually compress data. In fact encrypted data will
      * no longer be compressible in any meaningful way. This means if
      * you want to apply both compression and encryption to your
      * columns, you need to put this codec at the end of the chain
      * like "column Int32 Codec(Delta, LZ4,
      * Encrypted('AES-128-GCM-SIV'))".
      *
      * The key is obtained by executing a command specified in the
      * configuration file at startup, and if it doesn't specify a
      * command the codec refuses to process any data. The command is
      * expected to write a Base64-encoded key of any length, and we
      * apply HKDF-SHA-256 to derive a 128-bit key-generation key
      * (only the first half of the result is used). We then encrypt
      * blocks in AES-128-GCM-SIV with a universally fixed nonce (12
      * repeated NUL characters).
      *
      * This construct has a weakness due to the nonce being fixed at
      * all times: when the same data block is encrypted twice, the
      * resulting ciphertext will be exactly the same. We have to live
      * with this weakness because ciphertext must be deterministic,
      * as otherwise our engines like ReplicatedMergeTree cannot
      * deduplicate data blocks.
