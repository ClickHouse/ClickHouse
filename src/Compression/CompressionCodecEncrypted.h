/** This codec encrypts and decrypts blocks with AES-128 in
    * GCM-SIV mode (RFC-8452), which is the only cipher currently
    * supported. Although it is implemented as a compression codec
    * it doesn't actually compress data. In fact encrypted data will
    * no longer be compressible in any meaningful way. This means if
    * you want to apply both compression and encryption to your
    * columns, you need to put this codec at the end of the chain
    * like "column Int32 Codec(Delta, LZ4,
    * AES_128_GCM_SIV)".
    *
    * The key is obtained by executing a command specified in the
    * configuration file at startup, and if it doesn't specify a
    * command the codec refuses to process any data. The command is
    * expected to write a Base64-encoded key of any length, and we
    * apply HKDF-SHA-256 to derive a 128-bit key-generation key
    * (only the first half of the result is used). We then encrypt
    * blocks in AES-128-GCM-SIV with a universally fixed nonce (12
    * repeated NUL characters).
    *
    * This construct has a weakness due to the nonce being fixed at
    * all times: when the same data block is encrypted twice, the
    * resulting ciphertext will be exactly the same. We have to live
    * with this weakness because ciphertext must be deterministic,
    * as otherwise our engines like ReplicatedMergeTree cannot
    * deduplicate data blocks.
