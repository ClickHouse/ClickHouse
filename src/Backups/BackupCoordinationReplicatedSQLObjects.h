/// It's designed to make all hosts save the same objects to the backup even in case some objects change while
/// the backup is being produced. This is important to make RESTORE more predicitible.
///
/// For example, let's consider three replicas having access to the user-defined function `f1`.
/// This class ensures that the following files in the backup will be the same:
/// /shards/1/replicas/1/data/system/functions/f1.sql
/// /shards/1/replicas/2/data/system/functions/f1.sql
/// /shards/1/replicas/3/data/system/functions/f1.sql
///
/// To implement that this class chooses one host to write user-defined SQL objects for all the hosts so in fact all those files
/// in the example above are written by single host.
