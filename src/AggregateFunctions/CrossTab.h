      * φ² is χ² divided by the sample size (count).
      * χ² is the sum of squares of the normalized differences between the "expected" and "observed" statistics.
      * ("Expected" in the case when one of the hypotheses is true).
      * Something resembling the L2 distance.
      *
      * Note: statisticians use the name χ² for every statistic that has χ² distribution in many various contexts.
      *
      * Let's suppose that there is no association between the values a and b.
      * Then the frequency (e.g. probability) of (a, b) pair is equal to the multiplied frequencies of a and b:
      * count_ab / count = (count_a / count) * (count_b / count)
      * count_ab = count_a * count_b / count
      *
      * Let's calculate the difference between the values that are supposed to be equal if there is no association between a and b:
      * count_ab - count_a * count_b / count
      *
      * Let's sum the squares of the differences across all (a, b) pairs including the pairs that were not observed (count_ab = 0):
      * Then divide by the second term for normalization: (count_a * count_b / count)
      * We get:
      *   χ² = Σ_{a,b} (count_ab - (count_a * count_b) / count)² / ((count_a * count_b) / count).
      * 
      * However, iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) is not feasible: in the worst case it is quadratic, O(|A||B|)
      * if all entries may have count_ab = 0.
      * Instead, we can rewrite the formula into a sparse form that runs in O(N), where N is the number of
      * observed pairs (count_ab > 0), avoiding explicit iteration over zero cells.
      *
      * Expand (X - Y)² / Y = X² / Y - 2X + Y and sum term-wise:
      *   χ² = Σ_{a,b} count_ab² / ((count_a * count_b) / count)
      *        - 2 Σ_{a,b} count_ab
      *        + Σ_{a,b} (count_a * count_b) / count.
      *
      * Note that:
      *   Σ_{a,b} count_ab = count,
      *   Σ_{a,b} (count_a * count_b) / count
      *     = (1 / count) * Σ_a Σ_b (count_a * count_b)
      *     = (1 / count) * Σ_a [ count_a * Σ_b count_b ]  // count_a does not depend on b
      *     = (1 / count) * (Σ_a count_a) * (Σ_b count_b)
      *     = (1 / count) * count * count
      *     = count.
      *
      * Therefore
      *   χ² = Σ_{a,b} (count * count_ab²) / (count_a * count_b) - count.
      *
      * Divide by count to obtain φ² = χ² / count:
      *   φ² = Σ_{a,b} (count_ab²) / (count_a * count_b) - 1.
      * 
      * Note that in this formulation we iterate only over observed pairs (count_ab > 0),
      * because terms with count_ab = 0 contribute 0 to the sum; thus the computation is linear
      * in the number of observed pairs (O(N), where N = |count_ab|).
      * 
      * This will be the χ² statistics.
      * This statistic is used as a base for many other statistics.
