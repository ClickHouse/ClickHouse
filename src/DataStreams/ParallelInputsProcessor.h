/** Allows to process multiple block input streams (sources) in parallel, using specified number of threads.
  * Reads (pulls) blocks from any available source and passes it to specified handler.
  *
  * Before any reading, calls "readPrefix" method of sources in parallel.
  *
  * (As an example, "readPrefix" can prepare connections to remote servers,
  *  and we want this work to be executed in parallel for different sources)
  *
  * Implemented in following way:
  * - there are multiple input sources to read blocks from;
  * - there are multiple threads, that could simultaneously read blocks from different sources;
  * - "available" sources (that are not read in any thread right now) are put in queue of sources;
  * - when thread take a source to read from, it removes source from queue of sources,
  *    then read block from source and then put source back to queue of available sources.
