  * LIMITS_TOTAL - checks total amount of read data from leaf streams (i.e. data read from disk and remote servers).
  *  It is checks max_{rows,bytes}_to_read in progress handler and use info from ProcessListElement::progress_in for this.
  *  Currently this check is performed only in leaf streams.
