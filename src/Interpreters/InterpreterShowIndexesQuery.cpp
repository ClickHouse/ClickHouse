    /// Note about compatibility of fields 'column_name', 'seq_in_index' and 'expression' with MySQL:
    /// MySQL has non-functional and functional indexes.
    /// - Non-functional indexes only reference columns, e.g. 'col1, col2'. In this case, `SHOW INDEX` produces as many result rows as there
    ///   are indexed columns. 'column_name' and 'seq_in_index' (an ascending integer 1, 2, ...) are filled, 'expression' is empty.
    /// - Functional indexes can reference arbitrary expressions, e.g. 'col1 + 1, concat(col2, col3)'. 'SHOW INDEX' produces a single row
    ///   with `column_name` and `seq_in_index` empty and `expression` filled with the entire index expression. Only non-primary-key indexes
    ///   can be functional indexes.
    /// Above SELECT tries to emulate that. Caveats:
    /// 1. The primary key index sub-SELECT assumes the primary key expression is non-functional. Non-functional primary key indexes in
    ///    ClickHouse are possible but quiete obscure. In MySQL they are not possible at all.
    /// 2. Related to 1.: Poor man's tuple parsing with splitByString() in the PK sub-SELECT messes up for functional primary key index
    ///    expressions where the comma is not only used as separator between tuple components, e.g. in 'col1 + 1, concat(col2, col3)'.
    /// 3. The data skipping index sub-SELECT assumes the index expression is functional. 3rd party tools that expect MySQL semantics from
    ///    SHOW INDEX will probably not care as MySQL has no skipping indexes and they only use the result to figure out the primary key.
