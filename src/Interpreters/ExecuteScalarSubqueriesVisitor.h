/** Replace subqueries that return exactly one row
    * ("scalar" subqueries) to the corresponding constants.
    *
    * If the subquery returns more than one column, it is replaced by a tuple of constants.
    *
    * Features
    *
    * A replacement occurs during query analysis, and not during the main runtime.
    * This means that the progress indicator will not work during the execution of these requests,
    *  and also such queries can not be aborted.
    *
    * But the query result can be used for the index in the table.
    *
    * Scalar subqueries are executed on the request-initializer server.
    * The request is sent to remote servers with already substituted constants.
