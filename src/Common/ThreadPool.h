/** Very simple thread pool similar to boost::threadpool.
  * Advantages:
  * - catches exceptions and rethrows on wait.
  *
  * This thread pool can be used as a task queue.
  * For example, you can create a thread pool with 10 threads (and queue of size 10) and schedule 1000 tasks
  * - in this case you will be blocked to keep 10 tasks in fly.
  *
  * Thread: std::thread or something with identical interface.

  * Linux can create and destroy about 100 000 threads per second (quite good).
  * With simple ThreadPool (based on mutex and condvar) you can assign about 200 000 tasks per second
  * - not much difference comparing to not using a thread pool at all.
  *
  * But if you reuse OS threads instead of creating and destroying them, several benefits exist:
  * - allocator performance will usually be better due to reuse of thread local caches, especially for jemalloc:
  *   https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/1347
  * - address sanitizer and thread sanitizer will not fail due to global limit on number of created threads.
  * - program will work faster in gdb;
