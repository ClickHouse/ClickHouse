/// Does two things:
/// 1. Periodically reads the memory usage of the process from Linux cgroups.
///    You can specify soft or hard memory limits:
///    - When the soft memory limit is hit, drop jemalloc cache.
///    - When the hard memory limit is hit, update MemoryTracking metric to throw memory exceptions faster.
///    The goal of this is to avoid that the process hits the maximum allowed memory limit at which there is a good
///    chance that the Limux OOM killer terminates it. All of this is done is because internal memory tracking in
///    ClickHouse can unfortunately under-estimate the actually used memory.
/// 2. Periodically reads the the maximum memory available to the process (which can change due to cgroups settings).
///    You can specify a callback to react on changes. The callback typically reloads the configuration, i.e. Server
///    or Keeper configuration file. This reloads settings 'max_server_memory_usage' (Server) and 'max_memory_usage_soft_limit'
///    (Keeper) from which various other internal limits are calculated, including the soft and hard limits for (1.).
///    The goal of this is to provide elasticity when the container is scaled-up/scaled-down. The mechanism (polling
///    cgroups) is quite implicit, unfortunately there is currently no better way to communicate memory threshold changes
///    to the database.
