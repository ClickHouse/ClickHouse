/** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing
  *
  * Exponentially smoothed average over time is weighted average with weight proportional to negative exponent of the time passed.
  * For example, the last value is taken with weight 1/2, the value one second ago with weight 1/4, two seconds ago - 1/8, etc.
  * It can be understood as an average over sliding window, but with different kernel.
  *
  * As an advantage, it is easy to update. Instead of collecting values and calculating a series of x1 / 2 + x2 / 4 + x3 / 8...
  * just calculate x_old / 2 + x_new / 2.
  *
  * It is often used for resource usage metrics. For example, "load average" in Linux is exponentially smoothed moving average.
  * We can use exponentially smoothed counters in query scheduler.
