/// "Userspace page cache"
/// A cache for contents of remote files.
/// Uses MADV_FREE to allow Linux to evict pages from our cache under memory pressure.
/// Typically takes up almost all of the available memory, similar to the actual page cache.
///
/// Intended for caching data retrieved from distributed cache, but can be used for other things too,
/// just replace FileChunkState with a discriminated union, or something, if needed.
///
/// There are two fixed-size units of caching here:
///  * OS pages, typically 4 KiB each.
///  * Page chunks, 2 MiB each (configurable with page_cache_block_size setting).
///
/// Each file is logically split into aligned 2 MiB blocks, which are mapped to page chunks inside the cache.
/// They are cached independently from each other.
///
/// Each page chunk has a contiguous 2 MiB buffer that can be pinned and directly used e.g. by ReadBuffers.
/// While pinned (by at least one PinnedPageChunk), the pages are not reclaimable by the OS.
///
/// Inside each page chunk, any subset of pages may be populated. Unpopulated pages may or not be
/// mapped to any physical RAM. We maintain a bitmask that keeps track of which pages are populated.
/// Pages become unpopulated if they're reclaimed by the OS (when the page chunk is not pinned),
/// or if we just never populate them in the first place (e.g. if a file is shorter than 2 MiB we
/// still create a 2 MiB page chunk, but use only a prefix of it).
///
/// There are two separate eviction mechanisms at play:
///  * LRU eviction of page chunks in PageCache.
///  * OS reclaiming pages on memory pressure. We have no control over the eviction policy.
///    It probably picks the pages in the same order in which they were marked with MADV_FREE, so
///    effectively in the same LRU order as our policy in PageCache.
/// When using PageCache in oversubscribed fashion, using all available memory and relying on OS eviction,
/// the PageCache's eviction policy mostly doesn't matter. It just needs to be similar enough to the OS's
/// policy that we rarely evict chunks with unevicted pages.
///
/// We mmap memory directly instead of using allocator because this enables:
///  * knowing how much RAM the cache is using, via /proc/self/smaps,
///  * MADV_HUGEPAGE (use transparent huge pages - this makes MADV_FREE 10x less slow),
///  * MAP_NORESERVE (don't reserve swap space - otherwise large mmaps usually fail),
///  * MADV_DONTDUMP (don't include in core dumps),
///  * page-aligned addresses without padding.
///
/// madvise(MADV_FREE) call is slow: ~6 GiB/s (doesn't scale with more threads). Enabling transparent
/// huge pages (MADV_HUGEPAGE) makes it 10x less slow, so we do that. That makes the physical RAM allocation
/// work at 2 MiB granularity instead of 4 KiB, so the cache becomes less suitable for small files.
/// If this turns out to be a problem, we may consider allowing different mmaps to have different flags,
/// some having no huge pages.
/// Note that we do our bookkeeping at small-page granularity even if huge pages are enabled.
///
/// It's unfortunate that Linux's MADV_FREE eviction doesn't use the two-list strategy like the real
/// page cache (IIUC, MADV_FREE puts the pages at the head of the inactive list, and they can never
/// get to the active list).
/// If this turns out to be a problem, we could make PageCache do chunk eviction based on observed
/// system memory usage, so that most eviction is done by us, and the MADV_FREE eviction kicks in
/// only as a last resort. Then we can make PageCache's eviction policy arbitrarily more sophisticated.
