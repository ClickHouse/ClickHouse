/** memcpy function could work suboptimal if all the following conditions are met:
  * 1. Size of memory region is relatively small (approximately, under 50 bytes).
  * 2. Size of memory region is not known at compile-time.
  *
  * In that case, memcpy works suboptimal by following reasons:
  * 1. Function is not inlined.
  * 2. Much time/instructions are spend to process "tails" of data.
  *
  * There are cases when function could be implemented in more optimal way, with help of some assumptions.
  * One of that assumptions - ability to read and write some number of bytes after end of passed memory regions.
  * Under that assumption, it is possible not to implement difficult code to process tails of data and do copy always by big chunks.
  *
  * This case is typical, for example, when many small pieces of data are gathered to single contiguous piece of memory in a loop.
  * - because each next copy will overwrite excessive data after previous copy.
  *
  * Assumption that size of memory region is small enough allows us to not unroll the loop.
  * This is slower, when size of memory is actually big.
  *
  * Use with caution.
