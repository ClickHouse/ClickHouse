// Interfaces for abstract "slot" allocation and control.
// Slot is a virtual entity existing in a limited amount (CPUs or memory chunks, etc).
//
// Every slot can be in one of the following states:
//  * free: slot is available to be allocated.
//  * allocated: slot is allocated to a specific ISlotAllocation.
//
// Allocated slots can be in one of the following states:
//  * granted: allocated, but not yet acquired.
//  * acquired: a granted slot becomes acquired by using IAcquiredSlot.
//
// Example for CPU (see ConcurrencyControl.h). Every slot represents one CPU in the system.
// Slot allocation is a request to allocate specific number of CPUs for a specific query.
// Acquired slot is an entity that is held by a thread as long as it is running. This allows
// total number of threads in the system to be limited and the distribution process to be controlled.
//
// TODO:
// - for preemption - ability to return granted slot back and reacquire it later.
// - for memory allocations - variable size of slots (in bytes).
