/**
  * In some aggregation scenarios, when adding a key to the hash table, we
  * start with a temporary key object, and if it turns out to be a new key,
  * we must make it persistent (e.g. copy to an Arena) and use the resulting
  * persistent object as hash table key. This happens only for StringRef keys,
  * because other key types are stored by value, but StringRef is a pointer-like
  * type: the actual data are stored elsewhere. Even for StringRef, we don't
  * make a persistent copy of the key in each of the following cases:
  * 1) the aggregation method doesn't use temporary keys, so they're persistent
  *    from the start;
  * 1) the key is already present in the hash table;
  * 3) that particular key is stored by value, e.g. a short StringRef key in
  *    StringHashMap.
  *
  * In the past, the caller was responsible for making the key persistent after
  * in was inserted. emplace() returned whether the key is new or not, so the
  * caller only stored new keys (this is case (2) from the above list). However,
  * now we are adding a compound hash table for StringRef keys, so case (3)
  * appears. The decision about persistence now depends on some properties of
  * the key, and the logic of this decision is tied to the particular hash table
  * implementation. This means that the hash table user now doesn't have enough
  * data and logic to make this decision by itself.
  *
  * To support these new requirements, we now manage key persistence by passing
  * a special key holder to emplace(), which has the functions to make the key
  * persistent or to discard it. emplace() then calls these functions at the
  * appropriate moments.
  *
  * This approach has the following benefits:
  * - no extra runtime branches in the caller to make the key persistent.
  * - no additional data is stored in the hash table itself, which is important
  *   when it's used in aggregate function states.
  * - no overhead when the key memory management isn't needed: we just pass the
  *   bare key without any wrapper to emplace(), and the default callbacks do
  *   nothing.
  *
  * This file defines the default key persistence functions, as well as two
  * different key holders and corresponding functions for storing StringRef
  * keys to Arena.
