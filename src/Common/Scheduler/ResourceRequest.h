 * Request for a resource consumption. The main moving part of the scheduling subsystem.
 * Resource requests processing workflow:
 *
 * ----1=2222222222222=3=4=555555555555555=6-----> time
 *     ^     ^         ^ ^          ^      ^
 *     |     |         | |          |      |
 *  enqueue wait dequeue execute consume finish
 *
 *  1) Request is enqueued using ISchedulerQueue::enqueueRequest().
 *  2) Request competes with others for access to a resource; effectively just waiting in a queue.
 *  3) Scheduler calls ISchedulerNode::dequeueRequest() that returns the request.
 *  4) Callback ResourceRequest::execute() is called to provide access to the resource.
 *  5) The resource consumption is happening outside of the scheduling subsystem.
 *  6) ResourceRequest::finish() is called when consumption is finished.
 *
 * Steps (5) and (6) can be omitted if constraint is not used by the resource.
 *
 * Request can be created on stack or heap.
 * Request ownership is done outside of the scheduling subsystem.
 * After (6) request can be destructed safely.
 *
 * Request can also be canceled before (3) using ISchedulerQueue::cancelRequest().
 * Returning false means it is too late for request to be canceled. It should be processed in a regular way.
 * Returning true means successful cancel and therefore steps (4) and (5) are not going to happen.
