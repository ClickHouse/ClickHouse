/// Below are SQL definitions for views in "information_schema". Perhaps it would be more aesthetic to have them in .sql files
/// and embed them here instead. In fact, it has been that way using INCBIN macros until #54773. The problem was that when
/// existing .sql files were changed, the build system did not recognize that this source (.cpp) file changed and instead used
/// cached object files from previous builds.
///
/// INCBIN is one of many libraries to embed external data. We might wait a little bit longer and try #embed (*) which should
/// solve the problem once and for all after 40 years.
