/** Implements a table engine for the system table "numbers".
  * The table contains the only column number UInt64.
  * From this table, you can read all natural numbers, starting from 0 (to 2^64 - 1, and then again).
  *
  * You could also specify a limit (how many numbers to give).
  *
  * How to generate numbers?
  *
  * 1. First try a smart fashion:
  *
  * In this fashion we try to push filters and limit down to scanning.
  * Firstly extract plain ranges(no overlapping and ordered) by filter expressions.
  *
  * For example:
  *     where (numbers > 1 and numbers < 3) or (numbers in (4, 6)) or (numbers > 7 and numbers < 9)
  *
  * We will get ranges
  *     (1, 3), [4, 4], [6, 6], (7, 9)
  *
  * Then split the ranges evenly to one or multi-streams. With this way we will get result without large scanning.
  *
  * 2. If fail to extract plain ranges, fall back to ordinary scanning.
  *
  * If multithreaded is specified, numbers will be generated in several streams
  *  (and result could be out of order). If both multithreaded and limit are specified,
  *  the table could give you not exactly 1..limit range, but some arbitrary 'limit' numbers.
