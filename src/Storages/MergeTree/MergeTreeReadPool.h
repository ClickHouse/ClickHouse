/** Provides read tasks for MergeTreeThreadSelectAlgorithm in fine-grained batches, allowing for more
 *  uniform distribution of work amongst multiple threads. All parts and their ranges are divided into `threads`
 *  workloads with at most `sum_marks / threads` marks. Then, threads are performing reads from these workloads
 *  in "sequential" manner, requesting work in small batches. As soon as some thread has exhausted
 *  it's workload, it either is signaled that no more work is available (`do_not_steal_tasks == false`) or
 *  continues taking small batches from other threads' workloads (`do_not_steal_tasks == true`).
