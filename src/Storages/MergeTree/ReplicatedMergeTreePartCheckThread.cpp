        *   - or, if the replica never comes to life, then the administrator will delete or create a new replica with the same address and see everything from the beginning;
        * - if no one has such part or a part covering it, then
        *   - if there are two smaller parts, one with the same min block and the other with the same
        *     max block, we hope that all parts in between are present too and the needed part
        *     will appear on other replicas as a result of a merge.
        *   - otherwise, consider the part lost and delete the entry from the queue.
        *
        *   Note that this logic is not perfect - some part in the interior may be missing and the
        *   needed part will never appear. But precisely determining whether the part will appear as
        *   a result of a merge is complicated - we can't just check if all block numbers covered
        *   by the missing part are present somewhere (because gaps between blocks are possible)
        *   and to determine the constituent parts of the merge we need to query the replication log
        *   (both the common log and the queues of the individual replicas) and then, if the
        *   constituent parts are in turn not found, solve the problem recursively for them.
        *
        *   Considering the part lost when it is not in fact lost is very dangerous because it leads
        *   to divergent replicas and intersecting parts. So we err on the side of caution
        *   and don't delete the queue entry when in doubt.
