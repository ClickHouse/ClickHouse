/** Creates a local (at the same mount point) backup (snapshot) directory.

  * In the specified destination directory, it creates hard links on all source-directory files
  *  and in all nested directories, with saving (creating) all relative paths;
  *  and also `chown`, removing the write permission.
  *
  * This protects data from accidental deletion or modification,
  *  and is intended to be used as a simple means of protection against a human or program error,
  *  but not from a hardware failure.
  *
  * If max_level is specified, than only files with depth relative source_path less or equal max_level will be copied.
  *  So, if max_level=0 than only direct file child are copied.
  *
  * If `transaction` is provided, the changes will be added to it instead of performend on disk.
