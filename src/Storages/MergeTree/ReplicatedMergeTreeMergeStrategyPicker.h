/// That class allow to take a decisions about preferred strategy for a concreate merge.
///
/// Since that code is used in shouldExecuteLogEntry we need to be able to:
/// 1) make decision fast
/// 2) avoid excessive zookeeper operations

/// Because of that we need to cache some important things,

///
/// That means we need to refresh the state of that object regularly
///
/// NOTE: This class currently supports only single feature (execute_merges_on_single_replica_time_threshold),
/// may be extended to postpone merges in some other scenarios, namely
/// * always_fetch_merged_part
/// * try_fetch_recompressed_part_timeout
/// * (maybe, not for postpone) prefer_fetch_merged_part_time_threshold
///
/// NOTE: execute_merges_on_single_replica_time_threshold feature doesn't provide any strict guarantees.
/// When some replicas are added / removed we may execute some merges on more than one replica,
/// or not execute merge on any of replicas during execute_merges_on_single_replica_time_threshold interval.
/// (so it may be a bad idea to set that threshold to high values).
