/** Interface of algorithm to select data parts to merge
 *   (merge is also known as "compaction").
  * Following properties depend on it:
  *
  * 1. Number of data parts at some moment in time.
  *    If parts are merged frequently, then data will be represented by lower number of parts, in average,
  *     but with cost of higher write amplification.
  *
  * 2. Write amplification ratio: how much times, on average, source data was written
  *     (during initial writes and followed merges).
  *
  * Number of parallel merges are controlled outside of scope of this interface.
