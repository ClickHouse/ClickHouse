/// How a column is found in the manifest metrics of a data file. `metadata.json` keeps every schema the table had, and
/// each data file was written with one of them:
///
///     metadata.json
///       schemas:
///         schema-id 0: { field 1: k int }
///         schema-id 1: { field 1: k long }      after MODIFY COLUMN k Int64
///         schema-id 2: { field 1: w long }      after RENAME COLUMN k TO w: same field id
///       current-schema-id: 2
///     manifest entries:
///       file A, added by a snapshot of schema 0: lower_bounds {1: 4 bytes}, null_value_counts {1: ...}, ...
///       file B, added by a snapshot of schema 1: lower_bounds {1: 8 bytes}, ...
///
/// - The field id names a column across all schemas, so a rename keeps it, and the metrics are keyed by it.
/// - The schema id with which a file was written (`ProcessedManifestFileEntry::resolved_schema_id`) says how to read the
///   file's metrics: file A's bounds are an `int`, although the column is now `long`.
/// - A column missing from a file's schema was added after the file was written, so the file holds only NULLs in it.
/// Here the storage column name gives the field id once, in the schema of the read; then each file's schema gives the
/// type its bounds are decoded with, before they are converted to the storage type.
