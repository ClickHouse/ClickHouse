    /** Delays initialization of StorageMemory::read() until the first read is actually happen.
      * Usually, fore code like this:
      *
      *     auto out = StorageMemory::write();
      *     auto in = StorageMemory::read();
      *     out->write(new_data);
      *
      * `new_data` won't appear into `in`.
      *  However, if delayReadForGlobalSubqueries is called, first read from `in` will check for new_data and return it.
      *
      *
      * Why is delayReadForGlobalSubqueries needed?
      *
      * The fact is that when processing a query of the form
      *  SELECT ... FROM remote_test WHERE column GLOBAL IN (subquery),
      *  if the distributed remote_test table contains localhost as one of the servers,
      *  the query will be interpreted locally again (and not sent over TCP, as in the case of a remote server).
      *
      * The query execution pipeline will be:
      * CreatingSets
      *  subquery execution, filling the temporary table with _data1 (1)
      *  CreatingSets
      *   reading from the table _data1, creating the set (2)
      *   read from the table subordinate to remote_test.
      *
      * (The second part of the pipeline under CreateSets is a reinterpretation of the query inside StorageDistributed,
      *  the query differs in that the database name and tables are replaced with subordinates, and the subquery is replaced with _data1.)
      *
      * But when creating the pipeline, when creating the source (2), it will be found that the _data1 table is empty
      *  (because the query has not started yet), and empty source will be returned as the source.
      * And then, when the query is executed, an empty set will be created in step (2).
      *
      * Therefore, we make the initialization of step (2) delayed
      *  - so that it does not occur until step (1) is completed, on which the table will be populated.
