/// processors are scheduled across threads and there could be a situation
/// when all available threads will read from local replica and will just
/// forget about remote replicas existence. That is not what we want.
/// For parallel replicas we have to constantly answer to incoming requests
/// with a set of marks to read.
/// With the help of this class, we explicitly connect a "local" source with
/// all the remote ones. And thus achieve fairness somehow.
