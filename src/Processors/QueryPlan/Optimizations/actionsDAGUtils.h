/// * Input nodes are mapped by name.
/// * Function is mapped to function if all children are mapped and function names are same.
/// * Alias is mapped to it's children mapping.
/// * Monotonic function can be mapped to it's children mapping if direct mapping does not exist.
///   In this case, information about monotonicity is filled.
/// * Mapped node is nullptr if there is no mapping found.
///
/// Overall, directly mapped nodes represent equal calculations.
/// Notes:
/// * Mapped DAG can contain many nodes which represent the same calculation.
///   In this case mapping is ambiguous and only one node is mapped.
/// * Aliases for mapped DAG are not supported.
/// DAG for PK does not contain aliases and ambiguous nodes.
