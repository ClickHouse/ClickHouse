/** List of settings: type, name, default value, description, flags
  *
  * This looks rather unconvenient. It is done that way to avoid repeating settings in different places.
  * Note: as an alternative, we could implement settings to be completely dynamic in form of map: String -> Field,
  *  but we are not going to do it, because settings is used everywhere as static struct fields.
  *
  * `flags` can be either 0 or IMPORTANT.
  * A setting is "IMPORTANT" if it affects the results of queries and can't be ignored by older versions.
