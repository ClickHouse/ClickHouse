/// Client-server protocol.
///
/// Client opens a connection and sends Hello packet.
/// If client version is incompatible, the server can terminate the connection.
/// Server responds with Hello packet.
/// If server version is incompatible, the client can terminate the connection.
///
/// The main loop follows:
///
/// 1. The client sends Query packet.
///
/// Starting from version 50263 immediately after sending the Query packet the client starts
/// transfer of external (temporary) table (external storages) - one or several Data packets.
/// End of transmission is marked by an empty block.
/// At present, non-empty tables can be sent only along with SELECT query.
///
/// If the query is an INSERT (and thus requires data transfer from client), then the server transmits
/// Data packet containing empty block that describes the table structure.
/// Then the client sends one or several Data packets - data for insertion.
/// End of data is marked by the transmission of empty block.
/// Then the server sends EndOfStream packet.
///
/// If the query is a SELECT or a query of other type, then the server transmits packets of
/// one of the following types:
/// - Data - data corresponding to one block of query results.
/// - Progress - query execution progress.
/// - Exception - error description.
/// - EndOfStream - the end of data transmission.
///
/// The client should read packets until EndOfStream or Exception.
///
/// The client can also send Cancel packet - a request to cancel the query.
/// In this case the server can stop executing the query and return incomplete data,
/// but the client must still read until EndOfStream packet.
///
/// Also if there is profiling info and the client revision is recent enough, the server can
/// send one of the following packets before EndOfStream:
/// - Totals - a block with total values
/// - ProfileInfo - serialized BlockStreamProfileInfo structure.
///
/// If a query returns data, the server sends an empty header block containing
/// the description of resulting columns before executing the query.
/// Using this block the client can initialise the output formatter and display the prefix of resulting table
/// beforehand.
