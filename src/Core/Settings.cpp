For [MergeTree](../../engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree.md) tables. In order to reduce latency when processing queries, a block is compressed when writing the next mark if its size is at least `min_compress_block_size`. By default, 65,536.

The actual size of the block, if the uncompressed data is less than `max_compress_block_size`, is no less than this value and no less than the volume of data for one mark.

Let’s look at an example. Assume that `index_granularity` was set to 8192 during table creation.

We are writing a UInt32-type column (4 bytes per value). When writing 8192 rows, the total will be 32 KB of data. Since min_compress_block_size = 65,536, a compressed block will be formed for every two marks.

We are writing a URL column with the String type (average size of 60 bytes per value). When writing 8192 rows, the average will be slightly less than 500 KB of data. Since this is more than 65,536, a compressed block will be formed for each mark. In this case, when reading data from the disk in the range of a single mark, extra data won’t be decompressed.

The maximum size of blocks of uncompressed data before compressing for writing to a table. By default, 1,048,576 (1 MiB). Specifying a smaller block size generally leads to slightly reduced compression ratio, the compression and decompression speed increases slightly due to cache locality, and memory consumption is reduced.

:::note

Don’t confuse blocks for compression (a chunk of memory consisting of bytes) with blocks for query processing (a set of rows from a table).
)", 0) \
    M(UInt64, max_block_size, DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE, R"(
In ClickHouse, data is processed by blocks, which are sets of column parts. The internal processing cycles for a single block are efficient but there are noticeable costs when processing each block.

The `max_block_size` setting indicates the recommended maximum number of rows to include in a single block when loading data from tables. Blocks the size of `max_block_size` are not always loaded from the table: if ClickHouse determines that less data needs to be retrieved, a smaller block is processed.

The block size should not be too small to avoid noticeable costs when processing each block. It should also not be too large to ensure that queries with a LIMIT clause execute quickly after processing the first block. When setting `max_block_size`, the goal should be to avoid consuming too much memory when extracting a large number of columns in multiple threads and to preserve at least some cache locality.
)", 0) \
    M(UInt64, max_insert_block_size, DEFAULT_INSERT_BLOCK_SIZE, R"(
The size of blocks (in a count of rows) to form for insertion into a table.
This setting only applies in cases when the server forms the blocks.
For example, for an INSERT via the HTTP interface, the server parses the data format and forms blocks of the specified size.
But when using clickhouse-client, the client parses the data itself, and the ‘max_insert_block_size’ setting on the server does not affect the size of the inserted blocks.
The setting also does not have a purpose when using INSERT SELECT, since data is inserted using the same blocks that are formed after SELECT.

The default is slightly more than `max_block_size`. The reason for this is that certain table engines (`*MergeTree`) form a data part on the disk for each inserted block, which is a fairly large entity. Similarly, `*MergeTree` tables sort data during insertion, and a large enough block size allow sorting more data in RAM.

For queries that are completed quickly because of a LIMIT, you can set a lower ‘max_threads’. For example, if the necessary number of entries are located in every block and max_threads = 8, then 8 blocks are retrieved, although it would have been enough to read just one.

- [In order](#load_balancing-in_order)
- [First or random](#load_balancing-first_or_random)
- [Round robin](#load_balancing-round_robin)

See also:

- [distributed_replica_max_ignored_errors](#distributed_replica_max_ignored_errors)

### Random (by Default) {#load_balancing-random}

``` sql
load_balancing = random
```

The number of errors is counted for each replica. The query is sent to the replica with the fewest errors, and if there are several of these, to anyone of them.
Disadvantages: Server proximity is not accounted for; if the replicas have different data, you will also get different data.

### Nearest Hostname {#load_balancing-nearest_hostname}

``` sql
load_balancing = nearest_hostname
```

The number of errors is counted for each replica. Every 5 minutes, the number of errors is integrally divided by 2. Thus, the number of errors is calculated for a recent time with exponential smoothing. If there is one replica with a minimal number of errors (i.e. errors occurred recently on the other replicas), the query is sent to it. If there are multiple replicas with the same minimal number of errors, the query is sent to the replica with a hostname that is most similar to the server’s hostname in the config file (for the number of different characters in identical positions, up to the minimum length of both hostnames).

For instance, example01-01-1 and example01-01-2 are different in one position, while example01-01-1 and example01-02-2 differ in two places.
This method might seem primitive, but it does not require external data about network topology, and it does not compare IP addresses, which would be complicated for our IPv6 addresses.

Thus, if there are equivalent replicas, the closest one by name is preferred.
We can also assume that when sending a query to the same server, in the absence of failures, a distributed query will also go to the same servers. So even if different data is placed on the replicas, the query will return mostly the same results.

### Hostname levenshtein distance {#load_balancing-hostname_levenshtein_distance}

``` sql
load_balancing = hostname_levenshtein_distance
```

Just like `nearest_hostname`, but it compares hostname in a [levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) manner. For example:

``` text
example-clickhouse-0-0 ample-clickhouse-0-0
1

example-clickhouse-0-0 example-clickhouse-1-10
2

example-clickhouse-0-0 example-clickhouse-12-0
3
```

### In Order {#load_balancing-in_order}

``` sql
load_balancing = in_order
```

Replicas with the same number of errors are accessed in the same order as they are specified in the configuration.
This method is appropriate when you know exactly which replica is preferable.

### First or Random {#load_balancing-first_or_random}

``` sql
load_balancing = first_or_random
```

This algorithm chooses the first replica in the set or a random replica if the first is unavailable. It’s effective in cross-replication topology setups, but useless in other configurations.

The `first_or_random` algorithm solves the problem of the `in_order` algorithm. With `in_order`, if one replica goes down, the next one gets a double load while the remaining replicas handle the usual amount of traffic. When using the `first_or_random` algorithm, the load is evenly distributed among replicas that are still available.

It's possible to explicitly define what the first replica is by using the setting `load_balancing_first_offset`. This gives more control to rebalance query workloads among replicas.

### Round Robin {#load_balancing-round_robin}

``` sql
load_balancing = round_robin
```

This algorithm uses a round-robin policy across replicas with the same number of errors (only the queries with `round_robin` policy is accounted).

    M(Bool, skip_unavailable_shards, false, R"(
Enables or disables silently skipping of unavailable shards.

Shard is considered unavailable if all its replicas are unavailable. A replica is unavailable in the following cases:

- ClickHouse can’t connect to replica for any reason.

    When connecting to a replica, ClickHouse performs several attempts. If all these attempts fail, the replica is considered unavailable.

- Replica can’t be resolved through DNS.

    If replica’s hostname can’t be resolved through DNS, it can indicate the following situations:

    - Replica’s host has no DNS record. It can occur in systems with dynamic DNS, for example, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), where nodes can be unresolvable during downtime, and this is not an error.

    - Configuration error. ClickHouse configuration file contains a wrong hostname.

Possible values:

- 1 — skipping enabled.

    If a shard is unavailable, ClickHouse returns a result based on partial data and does not report node availability issues.

- 0 — skipping disabled.

Lower values mean higher priority. Threads with low `nice` priority values are executed more frequently than threads with high values.

Enables the quorum writes.

- If `insert_quorum < 2`, the quorum writes are disabled.
- If `insert_quorum >= 2`, the quorum writes are enabled.
- If `insert_quorum = 'auto'`, use majority number (`number_of_replicas / 2 + 1`) as quorum number.

Quorum writes

`INSERT` succeeds only when ClickHouse manages to correctly write data to the `insert_quorum` of replicas during the `insert_quorum_timeout`. If for any reason the number of replicas with successful writes does not reach the `insert_quorum`, the write is considered failed and ClickHouse will delete the inserted block from all the replicas where data has already been written.

When `insert_quorum_parallel` is disabled, all replicas in the quorum are consistent, i.e. they contain data from all previous `INSERT` queries (the `INSERT` sequence is linearized). When reading data written using `insert_quorum` and `insert_quorum_parallel` is disabled, you can turn on sequential consistency for `SELECT` queries using [select_sequential_consistency](#select_sequential_consistency).

ClickHouse generates an exception:

- If the number of available replicas at the time of the query is less than the `insert_quorum`.
- When `insert_quorum_parallel` is disabled and an attempt to write data is made when the previous block has not yet been inserted in `insert_quorum` of replicas. This situation may occur if the user tries to perform another `INSERT` query to the same table before the previous one with `insert_quorum` is completed.

:::

Enables or disables sequential consistency for `SELECT` queries. Requires `insert_quorum_parallel` to be disabled (enabled by default).

Possible values:

- 0 — Disabled.
- 1 — Enabled.

Usage

When sequential consistency is enabled, ClickHouse allows the client to execute the `SELECT` query only for those replicas that contain data from all previous `INSERT` queries executed with `insert_quorum`. If the client refers to a partial replica, ClickHouse will generate an exception. The SELECT query will not include data that has not yet been written to the quorum of replicas.

When `insert_quorum_parallel` is enabled (the default), then `select_sequential_consistency` does not work. This is because parallel `INSERT` queries can be written to different sets of quorum replicas so there is no guarantee a single replica will have received all writes.

**Usage**

Although `SET distributed_product_mode=global` can change the queries behavior for the distributed tables, it's not suitable for local tables or tables from external resources. Here is when the `prefer_global_in_and_join` setting comes into play.

For example, we have query serving nodes that contain local tables, which are not suitable for distribution. We need to scatter their data on the fly during distributed processing with the `GLOBAL` keyword — `GLOBAL IN`/`GLOBAL JOIN`.

Another use case of `prefer_global_in_and_join` is accessing tables created by external engines. This setting helps to reduce the number of calls to external sources while joining such tables: only one call per query.

Specifies which [JOIN](../../sql-reference/statements/select/join.md) algorithm is used.

Several algorithms can be specified, and an available one would be chosen for a particular query based on kind/strictness and table engine.

Possible values:

- default

 This is the equivalent of `hash` or `direct`, if possible (same as `direct,hash`)

- grace_hash

 [Grace hash join](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_join#Grace_hash_join) is used.  Grace hash provides an algorithm option that provides performant complex joins while limiting memory use.

 The first phase of a grace join reads the right table and splits it into N buckets depending on the hash value of key columns (initially, N is `grace_hash_join_initial_buckets`). This is done in a way to ensure that each bucket can be processed independently. Rows from the first bucket are added to an in-memory hash table while the others are saved to disk. If the hash table grows beyond the memory limit (e.g., as set by [`max_bytes_in_join`](/docs/en/operations/settings/query-complexity.md/#max_bytes_in_join)), the number of buckets is increased and the assigned bucket for each row. Any rows which don’t belong to the current bucket are flushed and reassigned.

 Supports `INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/FULL ALL/ANY JOIN`.

- hash

 [Hash join algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_join) is used. The most generic implementation that supports all combinations of kind and strictness and multiple join keys that are combined with `OR` in the `JOIN ON` section.

- parallel_hash

 A variation of `hash` join that splits the data into buckets and builds several hashtables instead of one concurrently to speed up this process.

 When using the `hash` algorithm, the right part of `JOIN` is uploaded into RAM.

- partial_merge

 A variation of the [sort-merge algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort-merge_join), where only the right table is fully sorted.

 The `RIGHT JOIN` and `FULL JOIN` are supported only with `ALL` strictness (`SEMI`, `ANTI`, `ANY`, and `ASOF` are not supported).

 When using the `partial_merge` algorithm, ClickHouse sorts the data and dumps it to the disk. The `partial_merge` algorithm in ClickHouse differs slightly from the classic realization. First, ClickHouse sorts the right table by joining keys in blocks and creates a min-max index for sorted blocks. Then it sorts parts of the left table by the `join key` and joins them over the right table. The min-max index is also used to skip unneeded right table blocks.

- direct

 This algorithm can be applied when the storage for the right table supports key-value requests.

 The `direct` algorithm performs a lookup in the right table using rows from the left table as keys. It's supported only by special storage such as [Dictionary](../../engines/table-engines/special/dictionary.md/#dictionary) or [EmbeddedRocksDB](../../engines/table-engines/integrations/embedded-rocksdb.md) and only the `LEFT` and `INNER` JOINs.

- auto

 When set to `auto`, `hash` join is tried first, and the algorithm is switched on the fly to another algorithm if the memory limit is violated.

- full_sorting_merge

 [Sort-merge algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort-merge_join) with full sorting joined tables before joining.

- prefer_partial_merge

 ClickHouse always tries to use `partial_merge` join if possible, otherwise, it uses `hash`. *Deprecated*, same as `partial_merge,hash`.

For example, notice how the following `SELECT` query is not modified (the default behavior):

```sql
EXPLAIN SYNTAX

    SELECT number AS x

The result is:

Let's set `convert_query_to_cnf` to `true` and see what changes:

```sql

(
    SELECT number AS x
    FROM numbers(20)
) AS a

Enables or disables the deduplication check for materialized views that receive data from Replicated\* tables.

Possible values:

Usage

By default, deduplication is not performed for materialized views but is done upstream, in the source table.
If an INSERTed block is skipped due to deduplication in the source table, there will be no insertion into attached materialized views. This behaviour exists to enable the insertion of highly aggregated data into materialized views, for cases where inserted blocks are the same after materialized view aggregation but derived from different INSERTs into the source table.
At the same time, this behaviour “breaks” `INSERT` idempotency. If an `INSERT` into the main table was successful and `INSERT` into a materialized view failed (e.g. because of communication failure with ClickHouse Keeper) a client will get an error and can retry the operation. However, the materialized view won’t receive the second insert because it will be discarded by deduplication in the main (source) table. The setting `deduplicate_blocks_in_dependent_materialized_views` allows for changing this behaviour. On retry, a materialized view will receive the repeat insert and will perform a deduplication check by itself,
ignoring check result for the source table, and will insert rows lost because of the first failure.

The setting allows a user to provide own deduplication semantic in MergeTree/ReplicatedMergeTree
For example, by providing a unique value for the setting in each INSERT statement,
user can avoid the same inserted data being deduplicated.

Possible values:

- Any string

`insert_deduplication_token` is used for deduplication _only_ when not empty.

For the replicated tables by default the only 100 of the most recent inserts for each partition are deduplicated (see [replicated_deduplication_window](merge-tree-settings.md/#replicated-deduplication-window), [replicated_deduplication_window_seconds](merge-tree-settings.md/#replicated-deduplication-window-seconds)).
For not replicated tables see [non_replicated_deduplication_window](merge-tree-settings.md/#non-replicated-deduplication-window).

:::note
`insert_deduplication_token` works on a partition level (the same as `insert_deduplication` checksum). Multiple partitions can have the same `insert_deduplication_token`.
:::

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_table
( A Int64 )
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY A
SETTINGS non_replicated_deduplication_window = 100;

INSERT INTO test_table SETTINGS insert_deduplication_token = 'test' VALUES (1);

-- the next insert won't be deduplicated because insert_deduplication_token is different
INSERT INTO test_table SETTINGS insert_deduplication_token = 'test1' VALUES (1);

-- the next insert will be deduplicated because insert_deduplication_token
-- is the same as one of the previous
INSERT INTO test_table SETTINGS insert_deduplication_token = 'test' VALUES (2);

The setting sets the maximum number of retries for ClickHouse Keeper (or ZooKeeper) requests during insert into replicated MergeTree. Only Keeper requests which failed due to network error, Keeper session timeout, or request timeout are considered for retries.

Possible values:

- Positive integer.
- 0 — Retries are disabled

Cloud default value: `20`.

Keeper request retries are done after some timeout. The timeout is controlled by the following settings: `insert_keeper_retry_initial_backoff_ms`, `insert_keeper_retry_max_backoff_ms`.
The first retry is done after `insert_keeper_retry_initial_backoff_ms` timeout. The consequent timeouts will be calculated as follows:
```
timeout = min(insert_keeper_retry_max_backoff_ms, latest_timeout * 2)
```

For example, if `insert_keeper_retry_initial_backoff_ms=100`, `insert_keeper_retry_max_backoff_ms=10000` and `insert_keeper_max_retries=8` then timeouts will be `100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400, 10000`.

    M(Timezone, session_timezone, "", R"(
Sets the implicit time zone of the current session or query.
The implicit time zone is the time zone applied to values of type DateTime/DateTime64 which have no explicitly specified time zone.
The setting takes precedence over the globally configured (server-level) implicit time zone.
A value of '' (empty string) means that the implicit time zone of the current session or query is equal to the [server time zone](../server-configuration-parameters/settings.md#timezone).

You can use functions `timeZone()` and `serverTimeZone()` to get the session time zone and server time zone.

Possible values:

-    Any time zone name from `system.time_zones`, e.g. `Europe/Berlin`, `UTC` or `Zulu`

Examples:

```sql
SELECT timeZone(), serverTimeZone() FORMAT CSV

"Europe/Berlin","Europe/Berlin"
```

```sql
SELECT timeZone(), serverTimeZone() SETTINGS session_timezone = 'Asia/Novosibirsk' FORMAT CSV

"Asia/Novosibirsk","Europe/Berlin"
```

Assign session time zone 'America/Denver' to the inner DateTime without explicitly specified time zone:

```sql
SELECT toDateTime64(toDateTime64('1999-12-12 23:23:23.123', 3), 3, 'Europe/Zurich') SETTINGS session_timezone = 'America/Denver' FORMAT TSV

1999-12-13 07:23:23.123
```

:::warning
Not all functions that parse DateTime/DateTime64 respect `session_timezone`. This can lead to subtle errors.
See the following example and explanation.
:::

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_tz (`d` DateTime('UTC')) ENGINE = Memory AS SELECT toDateTime('2000-01-01 00:00:00', 'UTC');

SELECT *, timeZone() FROM test_tz WHERE d = toDateTime('2000-01-01 00:00:00') SETTINGS session_timezone = 'Asia/Novosibirsk'
0 rows in set.

SELECT *, timeZone() FROM test_tz WHERE d = '2000-01-01 00:00:00' SETTINGS session_timezone = 'Asia/Novosibirsk'
┌───────────────────d─┬─timeZone()───────┐
│ 2000-01-01 00:00:00 │ Asia/Novosibirsk │
└─────────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

This happens due to different parsing pipelines:

- `toDateTime()` without explicitly given time zone used in the first `SELECT` query honors setting `session_timezone` and the global time zone.
- In the second query, a DateTime is parsed from a String, and inherits the type and time zone of the existing column`d`. Thus, setting `session_timezone` and the global time zone are not honored.

### Parallel processing using `SAMPLE` key

A query may be processed faster if it is executed on several servers in parallel. But the query performance may degrade in the following cases:

- The position of the sampling key in the partitioning key does not allow efficient range scans.
- Adding a sampling key to the table makes filtering by other columns less efficient.
- The sampling key is an expression that is expensive to calculate.
- The cluster latency distribution has a long tail, so that querying more servers increases the query overall latency.
