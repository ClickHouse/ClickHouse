                  (Hamming distance).

            <!-- Password could be specified in plaintext or in SHA256 (in hex format).

                 If you want to specify password in plaintext (not recommended), place it in 'password' element.
                 Example: <password>qwerty</password>.
                 Password could be empty.

                 If you want to specify SHA256, place it in 'password_sha256_hex' element.
                 Example: <password_sha256_hex>65e84be33532fb784c48129675f9eff3a682b27168c0ea744b2cf58ee02337c5</password_sha256_hex>

                 How to generate decent password:
                 Execute: PASSWORD=$(base64 < /dev/urandom | head -c8); echo "$PASSWORD"; echo -n "$PASSWORD" | sha256sum | tr -d '-'
                 In first line will be password and in second - corresponding SHA256.

            <!-- List of networks with open access.

                 To open access from everywhere, specify:
                    <ip>::/0</ip>

                 To open access only from localhost, specify:
                    <ip>::1</ip>
                    <ip>127.0.0.1</ip>

                 Each element of list has one of the following forms:
                 <ip> IP-address or network mask. Examples: 213.180.204.3 or 10.0.0.1/8 or 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.0
		     2a02:6b8::3 or 2a02:6b8::3/64 or 2a02:6b8::3/ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::.
                 <host> Hostname. Example: server01.yandex.ru.
                     To check access, DNS query is performed, and all received addresses compared to peer address.
                 <host_regexp> Regular expression for host names. Example, ^server\d\d-\d\d-\d\.yandex\.ru$
                     To check access, DNS PTR query is performed for peer address and then regexp is applied.
                     Then, for result of PTR query, another DNS query is performed and all received addresses compared to peer address.
                     Strongly recommended that regexp is ends with $
                 All results of DNS requests are cached till server restart.
