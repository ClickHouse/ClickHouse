/* The buffer is similar to ConcatReadBuffer, but writes data
 *
 * It has WriteBuffers sequence [prepared_sources, lazy_sources]
 * (lazy_sources contains not pointers themself, but their delayed constructors)
 *
 * Firtly, CascadeWriteBuffer redirects data to first buffer of the sequence
 * If current WriteBuffer cannot receive data anymore, it throws special exception CURRENT_WRITE_BUFFER_IS_EXHAUSTED in nextImpl() body,
 *  CascadeWriteBuffer prepare next buffer and continuously redirects data to it.
 * If there are no buffers anymore CascadeWriteBuffer throws an exception.
 *
 * NOTE: If you use one of underlying WriteBuffers buffers outside, you need sync its position() with CascadeWriteBuffer's position().
 * The sync is performed into nextImpl(), getResultBuffers() and destructor.
