/** The write is asynchronous - the data is first written to the local filesystem, and then sent to the remote servers.
 *  If the Distributed table uses more than one shard, then in order to support the write,
 *  when creating the table, an additional parameter must be specified for ENGINE - the sharding key.
 *  Sharding key is an arbitrary expression from the columns. For example, rand() or UserID.
 *  When writing, the data block is splitted by the remainder of the division of the sharding key by the total weight of the shards,
 *  and the resulting blocks are written in a compressed Native format in separate directories for sending.
 *  For each destination address (each directory with data to send), a separate thread is created in StorageDistributed,
 *  which monitors the directory and sends data. */
