/** During insertion, buffers the data in the RAM until certain thresholds are exceeded.
  * When thresholds are exceeded, flushes the data to another table.
  * When reading, it reads both from its buffers and from the subordinate table.
  *
  * The buffer is a set of num_shards blocks.
  * When writing, select the block number by the remainder of the `ThreadNumber` division by `num_shards` (or one of the others),
  *  and add rows to the corresponding block.
  * When using a block, it is locked by some mutex. If during write the corresponding block is already occupied
  *  - try to lock the next block in a round-robin fashion, and so no more than `num_shards` times (then wait for lock).
  * Thresholds are checked on insertion, and, periodically, in the background thread (to implement time thresholds).
  * Thresholds act independently for each shard. Each shard can be flushed independently of the others.
  * If a block is inserted into the table, which itself exceeds the max-thresholds, it is written directly to the subordinate table without buffering.
  * Thresholds can be exceeded. For example, if max_rows = 1 000 000, the buffer already had 500 000 rows,
  *  and a part of 800 000 rows is added, then there will be 1 300 000 rows in the buffer, and then such a block will be written to the subordinate table.
  *
  * When you destroy a Buffer table, all remaining data is flushed to the subordinate table.
  * The data in the buffer is not replicated, not logged to disk, not indexed. With a rough restart of the server, the data is lost.
