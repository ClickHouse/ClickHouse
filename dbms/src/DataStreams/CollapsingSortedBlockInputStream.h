  *  and no more than a row with the value of the column `sign_column = 1` ("positive row").
  * That is, it collapses the records from the change log.
  *
  * If the number of positive and negative rows is the same, and the last row is positive, then the first negative and last positive rows are written.
  * If the number of positive and negative rows is the same, and the last line is negative, it writes nothing.
  * If the positive by 1 is greater than the negative rows, then only the last positive row is written.
  * If negative by 1 is greater than positive rows, then only the first negative row is written.
  * Otherwise, a logical error.
