### <a id="2212"></a> ClickHouse release 22.12, 2022-12-15

:::warning

This release contains a faulty systemd service comment that might break the ClickHouse installation on upgrade for some Linux distributions. The systemd service changes the directory owner permissions on `/run/systemd`, causing all subsequent systemd operations to fail. It is advised that you skip upgrading to this version and instead upgrade to a newer version of ClickHouse.

Refer to this issue on GitHub for more details: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48285

:::

#### Upgrade Notes
* Fixed backward incompatibility in (de)serialization of states of `min`, `max`, `any*`, `argMin`, `argMax` aggregate functions with `String` argument. The incompatibility affects 22.9, 22.10 and 22.11 branches (fixed since 22.9.6, 22.10.4 and 22.11.2 correspondingly). Some minor releases of 22.3, 22.7 and 22.8 branches are also affected: 22.3.13...22.3.14 (fixed since 22.3.15), 22.8.6...22.8.9 (fixed since 22.8.10), 22.7.6 and newer (will not be fixed in 22.7, we recommend upgrading from 22.7.* to 22.8.10 or newer). This release note does not concern users that have never used affected versions. Incompatible versions append an extra `'\0'` to strings when reading states of the aggregate functions mentioned above. For example, if an older version saved state of `anyState('foobar')` to `state_column` then the incompatible version will print `'foobar\0'` on `anyMerge(state_column)`. Also incompatible versions write states of the aggregate functions without trailing `'\0'`. Newer versions (that have the fix) can correctly read data written by all versions including incompatible versions, except one corner case. If an incompatible version saved a state with a string that actually ends with null character, then newer version will trim trailing `'\0'` when reading state of affected aggregate function. For example, if an incompatible version saved state of `anyState('abrac\0dabra\0')` to `state_column` then newer versions will print `'abrac\0dabra'` on `anyMerge(state_column)`. The issue also affects distributed queries when an incompatible version works in a cluster together with older or newer versions. [#43038](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43038) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix), [Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)). Note: all the official ClickHouse builds already include the patches. This is not necessarily true for unofficial third-party builds that should be avoided.

#### New Feature
* Add `BSONEachRow` input/output format. In this format, ClickHouse formats/parses each row as a separate BSON document and each column is formatted/parsed as a single BSON field with the column name as the key. [#42033](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42033) ([mark-polokhov](https://github.com/mark-polokhov)).
* Add `grace_hash` JOIN algorithm, it can be enabled with `SET join_algorithm = 'grace_hash'`. [#38191](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38191) ([BigRedEye](https://github.com/BigRedEye), [Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Allow configuring password complexity rules and checks for creating and changing users. [#43719](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43719) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Mask sensitive information in logs; mask secret parts in the output of queries `SHOW CREATE TABLE` and `SELECT FROM system.tables`. Also resolves [#41418](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41418). [#43227](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43227) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add `GROUP BY ALL` syntax: [#37631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37631). [#42265](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42265) ([刘陶峰](https://github.com/taofengliu)).
* Add `FROM table SELECT column` syntax. [#41095](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41095) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Added function `concatWithSeparator` and `concat_ws` as an alias for Spark SQL compatibility. A function `concatWithSeparatorAssumeInjective` added as a variant to enable GROUP BY optimization, similarly to `concatAssumeInjective`. [#43749](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43749) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Added `multiplyDecimal` and `divideDecimal` functions for decimal operations with fixed precision. [#42438](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42438) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Added `system.moves` table with list of currently moving parts. [#42660](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42660) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Add support for embedded Prometheus endpoint for ClickHouse Keeper. [#43087](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43087) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Support numeric literals with `_` as the separator, for example, `1_000_000`. [#43925](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43925) ([jh0x](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Added possibility to use an array as a second parameter for `cutURLParameter` function. It will cut multiple parameters. Close [#6827](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6827). [#43788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43788) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* Add a column with the expression of the index in the `system.data_skipping_indices` table. [#43308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43308) ([Guillaume Tassery](https://github.com/YiuRULE)).
* Add column `engine_full` to system table `databases` so that users can access the entire engine definition of a database via system tables. [#43468](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43468) ([凌涛](https://github.com/lingtaolf)).
* New hash function [xxh3](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash) added. Also, the performance of `xxHash32` and `xxHash64` are improved on ARM thanks to a library update. [#43411](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43411) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Added support to define constraints for merge tree settings. For example you can forbid overriding the `storage_policy` by users. [#43903](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43903) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Add a new setting `input_format_json_read_objects_as_strings` that allows the parsing of nested JSON objects into Strings in all JSON input formats. This setting is disabled by default. [#44052](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44052) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Support deduplication for asynchronous inserts. Before this change, async inserts did not support deduplication, because multiple small inserts coexisted in one inserted batch. Closes [#38075](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38075). [#43304](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43304) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Add support for cosine distance for the experimental Annoy (vector similarity search) index. [#42778](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42778) ([Filatenkov Artur](https://github.com/FArthur-cmd)).
* Add `CREATE / ALTER / DROP NAMED COLLECTION` queries. [#43252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43252) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)). This feature is under development and the queries are not effective as of version 22.12. This changelog entry is added only to avoid confusion. Restrict default access to named collections to the user defined in config. This requires that `show_named_collections = 1` is set to be able to see them. [#43325](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43325) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)). The `system.named_collections` table is introduced [#43147](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43147) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Add settings `max_streams_for_merge_tree_reading` and `allow_asynchronous_read_from_io_pool_for_merge_tree`. Setting `max_streams_for_merge_tree_reading` limits the number of reading streams for MergeTree tables. Setting `allow_asynchronous_read_from_io_pool_for_merge_tree` enables a background I/O pool to read from `MergeTree` tables. This may increase performance for I/O bound queries if used together with `max_streams_to_max_threads_ratio` or `max_streams_for_merge_tree_reading`. [#43260](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43260) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)). This improves performance up to 100 times in case of high latency storage, low number of CPU and high number of data parts.
* Settings `merge_tree_min_rows_for_concurrent_read_for_remote_filesystem/merge_tree_min_bytes_for_concurrent_read_for_remote_filesystem` did not respect adaptive granularity. Fat rows did not decrease the number of read rows (as it was done for `merge_tree_min_rows_for_concurrent_read/merge_tree_min_bytes_for_concurrent_read`, which could lead to high memory usage when using remote filesystems. [#43965](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43965) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Optimized the number of list requests to ZooKeeper or ClickHouse Keeper when selecting a part to merge. Previously it could produce thousands of requests in some cases. Fixes [#43647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43647). [#43675](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43675) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Optimization is getting skipped now if `max_size_to_preallocate_for_aggregation` has too small a value. The default value of this setting increased to `10^8`. [#43945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43945) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Speed-up server shutdown by avoiding cleaning up of old data parts. Because it is unnecessary after https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41145. [#43760](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43760) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Merging on initiator now uses the same memory bound approach as merging of local aggregation results if `enable_memory_bound_merging_of_aggregation_results` is set. [#40879](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40879) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Keeper improvement: try syncing logs to disk in parallel with replication. [#43450](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43450) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Keeper improvement: requests are batched more often. The batching can be controlled with the new setting `max_requests_quick_batch_size`. [#43686](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43686) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).

#### Improvement
* Implement referential dependencies and use them to create tables in the correct order while restoring from a backup. [#43834](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43834) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Substitute UDFs in `CREATE` query to avoid failures during loading at startup. Additionally, UDFs can now be used as `DEFAULT` expressions for columns. [#43539](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43539) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Change how the following queries delete parts: TRUNCATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE DROP PART, ALTER TABLE DROP PARTITION. Now, these queries make empty parts which cover the old parts. This makes the TRUNCATE query work without a followedexclusive lock which means concurrent reads aren't locked. Also achieved durability in all those queries. If the request succeeds, then no resurrected parts appear later. Note that atomicity is achieved only with transaction scope. [#41145](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41145) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* `SET param_x` query no longer requires manual string serialization for the value of the parameter. For example, query `SET param_a = '[\'a\', \'b\']'` can now be written like `SET param_a = ['a', 'b']`. [#41874](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41874) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Show read rows in the progress indication while reading from STDIN from client. Closes [#43423](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43423). [#43442](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43442) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Show progress bar while reading from s3 table function / engine. [#43454](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43454) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Progress bar will show both read and written rows. [#43496](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43496) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* `filesystemAvailable` and related functions support one optional argument with disk name, and change `filesystemFree` to `filesystemUnreserved`. Closes [#35076](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35076). [#42064](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42064) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Integration with LDAP: increased the default value of search_limit to 256, and added LDAP server config option to change that to an arbitrary value. Closes: [#42276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42276). [#42461](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42461) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk)).
* Allow the removal of sensitive information (see the `query_masking_rules` in the configuration file) from the exception messages as well. Resolves [#41418](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41418). [#42940](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42940) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Support queries like `SHOW FULL TABLES ...` for MySQL compatibility. [#43910](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43910) ([Filatenkov Artur](https://github.com/FArthur-cmd)).
* Keeper improvement: Add 4lw command `rqld` which can manually assign a node as leader. [#43026](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43026) ([JackyWoo](https://github.com/JackyWoo)).
* Apply connection timeout settings for Distributed async INSERT from the query. [#43156](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43156) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* The `unhex` function now supports `FixedString` arguments. [issue42369](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42369). [#43207](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43207) ([DR](https://github.com/freedomDR)).
* Priority is given to deleting completely expired parts according to the TTL rules, see [#42869](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42869). [#43222](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43222) ([zhongyuankai](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* More precise and reactive CPU load indication in clickhouse-client. [#43307](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43307) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Support reading of subcolumns of nested types from storage `S3` and table function `s3` with formats `Parquet`, `Arrow` and `ORC`. [#43329](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43329) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Add `table_uuid` column to the `system.parts` table. [#43404](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43404) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added client option to display the number of locally processed rows in non-interactive mode (`--print-num-processed-rows`). [#43407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43407) ([jh0x](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Implement `aggregation-in-order` optimization on top of a query plan. It is enabled by default (but works only together with `optimize_aggregation_in_order`, which is disabled by default). Set `query_plan_aggregation_in_order = 0` to use the previous AST-based version. [#43592](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43592) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Allow to collect profile events with `trace_type = 'ProfileEvent'` to `system.trace_log` on each increment with current stack, profile event name and value of the increment. It can be enabled by the setting `trace_profile_events` and used to investigate performance of queries. [#43639](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43639) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Add a new setting `input_format_max_binary_string_size` to limit string size in RowBinary format. [#43842](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43842) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* When ClickHouse requests a remote HTTP server, and it returns an error, the numeric HTTP code was not displayed correctly in the exception message. Closes [#43919](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43919). [#43920](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43920) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Correctly report errors in queries even when multiple JOINs optimization is taking place. [#43583](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43583) ([Salvatore](https://github.com/tbsal)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement

* Systemd integration now correctly notifies systemd that the service is really started and is ready to serve requests. [#43400](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43400) ([Коренберг Марк](https://github.com/socketpair)).
* Added the option to build ClickHouse with OpenSSL using the [OpenSSL FIPS Module](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man7/fips_module.html). This build type has not been tested to validate security and is not supported. [#43991](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43991) ([Boris Kuschel](https://github.com/bkuschel)).
* Upgrade to the new `DeflateQpl` compression codec which has been implemented in a previous PR (details: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39494). This patch improves codec on below aspects: 1. QPL v0.2.0 to QPL v0.3.0 [Intel® Query Processing Library (QPL)](https://github.com/intel/qpl) 2. Improve CMake file for fixing QPL build issues for QPL v0.3.0. 3. Link the QPL library with libaccel-config at build time instead of runtime loading on QPL v0.2.0 (dlopen) 4. Fixed log print issue in CompressionCodecDeflateQpl.cpp. [#44024](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44024) ([jasperzhu](https://github.com/jinjunzh)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in official stable or prestable release)

* Fixed bug which could lead to deadlock while using asynchronous inserts. [#43233](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43233) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fix some incorrect logic in AST level optimization `optimize_normalize_count_variants`. [#43873](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43873) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Fix a case when mutations are not making progress when checksums do not match between replicas (e.g. caused by a change in data format on an upgrade). [#36877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36877) ([nvartolomei](https://github.com/nvartolomei)).
* Fix the `skip_unavailable_shards` optimization which did not work with the `hdfsCluster` table function. [#43236](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43236) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Fix `s3` support for the `?` wildcard. Closes [#42731](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42731). [#43253](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43253) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Fix functions `arrayFirstOrNull` and `arrayLastOrNull` or null when the array contains `Nullable` elements. [#43274](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43274) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Fix incorrect `UserTimeMicroseconds`/`SystemTimeMicroseconds` accounting related to Kafka tables. [#42791](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42791) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Do not suppress exceptions in `web` disks. Fix retries for the `web` disk. [#42800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42800) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fixed (logical) race condition between inserts and dropping materialized views. A race condition happened when a Materialized View was dropped at the same time as an INSERT, where the MVs were present as a dependency of the insert at the begining of the execution, but the table has been dropped by the time the insert chain tries to access it, producing either an `UNKNOWN_TABLE` or `TABLE_IS_DROPPED` exception, and stopping the insertion. After this change, we avoid these exceptions and just continue with the insert if the dependency is gone. [#43161](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43161) ([AlfVII](https://github.com/AlfVII)).
* Fix undefined behavior in the `quantiles` function, which might lead to uninitialized memory. Found by fuzzer. This closes [#44066](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44066). [#44067](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/44067) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Additional check on zero uncompressed size is added to `CompressionCodecDelta`. [#43255](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43255) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Flatten arrays from Parquet to avoid an issue with inconsistent data in arrays. These incorrect files can be generated by Apache Iceberg. [#43297](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43297) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Fix bad cast from `LowCardinality` column when using short circuit function execution. [#43311](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43311) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fixed queries with `SAMPLE BY` with prewhere optimization on tables using `Merge` engine. [#43315](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43315) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Check and compare the content of the `format_version` file in `MergeTreeData` so that tables can be loaded even if the storage policy was changed. [#43328](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43328) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Fix possible (very unlikely) "No column to rollback" logical error during INSERT into `Buffer` tables. [#43336](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43336) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix a bug that allowed the parser to parse an unlimited amount of round brackets into one function if `allow_function_parameters` is set. [#43350](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43350) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* `MaterializeMySQL` (experimental feature) support DDL： `drop table t1, t2` and compatible with most of MySQL DROP DDL. [#43366](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43366) ([zzsmdfj](https://github.com/zzsmdfj)).
* `session_log` (experimental feature): Fixed the inability to log in (because of failure to create the session_log entry) in a very rare case of messed up setting profiles. [#42641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42641) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk)).
* Fix possible `Cannot create non-empty column with type Nothing` in functions `if`/`multiIf`. Closes [#43356](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43356). [#43368](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43368) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix a bug when a row level filter uses the default value of a column. [#43387](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43387) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Query with `DISTINCT` + `LIMIT BY` + `LIMIT` can return fewer rows than expected. Fixes [#43377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43377). [#43410](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43410) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Fix `sumMap` for `Nullable(Decimal(...))`. [#43414](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43414) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix `date_diff` for hour/minute on macOS. Close [#42742](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42742). [#43466](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43466) ([zzsmdfj](https://github.com/zzsmdfj)).
* Fix incorrect memory accounting because of merges/mutations. [#43516](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43516) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fixed primary key analysis with conditions involving `toString(enum)`. [#43596](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43596) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)). This error has been found by @tisonkun.
* Ensure consistency when `clickhouse-copier` updates status and `attach_is_done` in Keeper after partition attach is done. [#43602](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43602) ([lzydmxy](https://github.com/lzydmxy)).
* During the recovery of a lost replica of a `Replicated` database (experimental feature), there could a situation where we need to atomically swap two table names (use EXCHANGE). Previously we tried to use two RENAME queries, which was obviously failing and moreover, failed the whole recovery process of the database replica. [#43628](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43628) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

* `JSONExtract` family of functions will now attempt to coerce to the requested type. [#41502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41502) ([Márcio Martins](https://github.com/marcioapm)).

#### New Feature
* Adds support for retries during INSERTs into ReplicatedMergeTree when a session with ClickHouse Keeper is lost. Apart from fault tolerance, it aims to provide better user experience, - avoid returning a user an error during insert if keeper is restarted (for example, due to upgrade). [#42607](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42607) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Add `Hudi` and `DeltaLake` table engines, read-only, only for tables on S3. [#41054](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41054) ([Daniil Rubin](https://github.com/rubin-do), [Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add table function `hudi` and `deltaLake`. [#43080](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43080) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Support for composite time intervals. 1. Add, subtract and negate operations are now available on Intervals. In the case where the types of Intervals are different, they will be transformed into the Tuple of those types. 2. A tuple of intervals can be added to or subtracted from a Date/DateTime field. 3. Added parsing of Intervals with different types, for example: `INTERVAL '1 HOUR 1 MINUTE 1 SECOND'`. [#42195](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42195) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Added `**` glob support for recursive directory traversal of the filesystem and S3. Resolves [#36316](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36316). [#42376](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42376) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Introduce `s3_plain` disk type for write-once-read-many operations. Implement `ATTACH` of `MergeTree` table for `s3_plain` disk. [#42628](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42628) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added applied row-level policies to `system.query_log`. [#39819](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39819) ([Vladimir Chebotaryov](https://github.com/quickhouse)).
* Add four-letter command `csnp` for manually creating snapshots in ClickHouse Keeper. Additionally, `lgif` was added to get Raft information for a specific node (e.g. index of last created snapshot, last committed log index). [#41766](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41766) ([JackyWoo](https://github.com/JackyWoo)).
* Add function `ascii` like in Apache Spark: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/#ascii. [#42670](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42670) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).

* Add function `randCanonical`, which is similar to the `rand` function in Apache Spark or Impala. The function generates pseudo random results with independent and identically distributed uniformly distributed values in [0, 1). [#43124](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43124) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add function `displayName`, closes [#36770](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36770). [#37681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37681) ([hongbin](https://github.com/xlwh)).
* Add `min_age_to_force_merge_on_partition_only` setting to optimize old parts for the entire partition only. [#42659](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42659) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).

* ClickHouse Keeper performance improvement: improve commit performance for cases when many different nodes have uncommitted states. This should help with cases when a follower node can't sync fast enough. [#42926](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42926) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* A condition like `NOT LIKE 'prefix%'` can use the primary index. [#42209](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42209) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Support type `Object` inside other types, e.g. `Array(JSON)`. [#36969](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36969) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

Handle (ignore) SAVEPOINT queries in MaterializedMySQL. [#43086](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43086) ([Stig Bakken](https://github.com/stigsb)).

#### Improvement
* Trivial queries with small LIMIT will properly determine the number of estimated rows to read, so that the threshold will be checked properly. Closes [#7071](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7071). [#42580](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42580) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).

Resolves [#42414](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42414) Implementation: * Added a new field allow_readonly to table system.table_functions. * Updated to use new field allow_readonly to allow using table functions in readonly mode. Testing: * Added a test for filesystem tests/queries/0_stateless/02473_functions_in_readonly_mode.sh Documentation: * Updated the english documentation for Table Functions. [#42708](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42708) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* The `system.asynchronous_metrics` gets embedded documentation. This documentation is also exported to Prometheus. Fixed an error with the metrics about `cache` disks - they were calculated only for one arbitrary cache disk instead all of them. This closes [#7644](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7644). [#43194](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43194) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Remove covered parts for fetched part (to avoid possible replication delay grows). [#39737](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39737) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* If `/dev/tty` is available, the progress in clickhouse-client and clickhouse-local will be rendered directly to the terminal, without writing to STDERR. It allows getting progress even if STDERR is redirected to a file, and the file will not be polluted by terminal escape sequences. The progress can be disabled by `--progress false`. This closes [#32238](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32238). [#42003](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42003) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Improve using structure from insertion table in table functions, now setting `use_structure_from_insertion_table_in_table_functions` has new possible value - `2` that means that ClickHouse will try to determine if we can use structure from insertion table or not automatically. Closes [#40028](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40028). [#42320](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42320) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix no progress indication on INSERT FROM INFILE. Closes [#42548](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42548). [#42634](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42634) ([chen](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).

* Allow to use `Date32` arguments for `formatDateTime` and `FROM_UNIXTIME` functions. [#42737](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42737) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* Update tzdata to 2022f. Mexico will no longer observe DST except near the US border: https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/mexico-abolishes-dst-2022.html. Chihuahua moves to year-round UTC-6 on 2022-10-30. Fiji no longer observes DST. See https://github.com/google/cctz/pull/235 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tzdata/+bug/1995209.

* Increase the size of upload part exponentially for backup to S3 to avoid errors about max 10 000 parts limit of the multipart upload to s3. [#42833](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42833) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* When the merge task is continuously busy and the disk space is insufficient, the completely expired parts cannot be selected and dropped, resulting in insufficient disk space. My idea is that when the entire Part expires, there is no need for additional disk space to guarantee, ensure the normal execution of TTL. [#42869](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42869) ([zhongyuankai](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* Add `oss` function and `OSS` table engine (this is convenient for users). oss is fully compatible with s3. [#43155](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43155) ([zzsmdfj](https://github.com/zzsmdfj)).

* Modify the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables in a way so that ClickHouse can connect to itself using the MySQL compatibility protocol. Add columns instead of aliases (related to [#9769](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9769)). It will improve the compatibility with various MySQL clients. [#43198](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43198) ([Filatenkov Artur](https://github.com/FArthur-cmd)).
* Add some functions for compatibility with PowerBI, when it connects using MySQL protocol [#42612](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42612) ([Filatenkov Artur](https://github.com/FArthur-cmd)).
* Better usability for Dashboard on changes [#42872](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42872) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).

* Before the fix, the user-defined config was preserved by RPM in `$file.rpmsave`. The PR fixes it and won't replace the user's files from packages. [#42936](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42936) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Remove some libraries from Ubuntu Docker image. [#42622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42622) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in official stable or prestable release)

* Updated normaliser to clone the alias ast. Resolves [#42452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42452) Implementation: * Updated QueryNormalizer to clone alias ast, when its replaced. Previously just assigning the same leads to exception in LogicalExpressinsOptimizer as it would be the same parent being inserted again. * This bug is not seen with new analyser (allow_experimental_analyzer), so no changes for it.

* Rename cache commands: `show caches` -> `show filesystem caches`, `describe cache` -> `describe filesystem cache`. [#41508](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41508) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Remove support for the `WITH TIMEOUT` section for `LIVE VIEW`. This closes [#40557](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40557). [#42173](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42173) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove support for the `{database}` macro from the client's prompt. It was displayed incorrectly if the database was unspecified and it was not updated on `USE` statements. This closes [#25891](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/25891). [#42508](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42508) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### New Feature
* Composable protocol configuration is added. Now different protocols can be set up with different listen hosts. Protocol wrappers such as PROXYv1 can be set up over any other protocols (TCP, TCP secure, MySQL, Postgres). [#41198](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41198) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Add `S3` as a new type of the destination of backups. Support BACKUP to S3 with as-is path/data structure. [#42333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42333) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)), [#42232](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42232) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added functions (`randUniform`, `randNormal`, `randLogNormal`, `randExponential`, `randChiSquared`, `randStudentT`, `randFisherF`, `randBernoulli`, `randBinomial`, `randNegativeBinomial`, `randPoisson`) to generate random values according to the specified distributions. This closes [#21834](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21834). [#42411](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42411) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* An improvement for ClickHouse Keeper: add support for uploading snapshots to S3. S3 information can be defined inside `keeper_server.s3_snapshot`. [#41342](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41342) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Added an aggregate function `analysisOfVariance` (`anova`) to perform a statistical test over several groups of normally distributed observations to find out whether all groups have the same mean or not. Original PR [#37872](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37872). [#42131](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42131) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Support limiting of temporary data stored on disk using settings `max_temporary_data_on_disk_size_for_user`/`max_temporary_data_on_disk_size_for_query` . [#40893](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40893) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Add setting `format_json_object_each_row_column_for_object_name` to write/parse object name as column value in JSONObjectEachRow format. [#41703](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41703) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add BLAKE3 hash-function to SQL. [#33435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33435) ([BoloniniD](https://github.com/BoloniniD)).
* The function `javaHash` has been extended to integers. [#41131](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41131) ([JackyWoo](https://github.com/JackyWoo)).
* Add OpenTelemetry support to ON CLUSTER DDL (require `distributed_ddl_entry_format_version` to be set to 4). [#41484](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41484) ([Frank Chen](https://github.com/FrankChen021)).
* Added system table `asynchronous_insert_log`. It contains information about asynchronous inserts (including results of queries in fire-and-forget mode (with `wait_for_async_insert=0`)) for better introspection. [#42040](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42040) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Add support for methods `lz4`, `bz2`, `snappy` in HTTP's `Accept-Encoding` which is a non-standard extension to HTTP protocol. [#42071](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42071) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Adds Morton Coding (ZCurve) encode/decode functions. [#41753](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41753) ([Constantine Peresypkin](https://github.com/pkit)).
* Add support for `SET setting_name = DEFAULT`. [#42187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42187) ([Filatenkov Artur](https://github.com/FArthur-cmd)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Added new infrastructure for query analysis and planning under the `allow_experimental_analyzer` setting. [#31796](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31796) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Initial implementation of Kusto Query Language. Please don't use it. [#37961](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37961) ([Yong Wang](https://github.com/kashwy)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Relax the "Too many parts" threshold. This closes [#6551](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6551). Now ClickHouse will allow more parts in a partition if the average part size is large enough (at least 10 GiB). This allows to have up to petabytes of data in a single partition of a single table on a single server, which is possible using disk shelves or object storage. [#42002](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42002) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Implement operator precedence element parser to make the required stack size smaller. [#34892](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34892) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* DISTINCT in order optimization leverage sorting properties of data streams. This improvement will enable reading in order for DISTINCT if applicable (before it was necessary to provide ORDER BY for columns in DISTINCT). [#41014](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41014) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* ColumnVector: optimize UInt8 index with AVX512VBMI. [#41247](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41247) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).
* Optimize the lock contentions for `ThreadGroupStatus::mutex`. The performance experiments of **SSB** (Star Schema Benchmark) on the ICX device (Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 CPU, 80 cores, 160 threads) shows that this change could bring a **2.95x** improvement of the geomean of all subcases' QPS. [#41675](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41675) ([Zhiguo Zhou](https://github.com/ZhiguoZh)).
* Add `ldapr` capabilities to AArch64 builds. This is supported from Graviton 2+, Azure and GCP instances. Only appeared in clang-15 [not so long ago](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/9609b5daffe9fd28d83d83da895abc5113f76c24). [#41778](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41778) ([Daniel Kutenin](https://github.com/danlark1)).
* Improve performance when comparing strings and one argument is an empty constant string. [#41870](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41870) ([Jiebin Sun](https://github.com/jiebinn)).
* Optimize `insertFrom` of ColumnAggregateFunction to share Aggregate State in some cases. [#41960](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41960) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Make writing to `azure_blob_storage` disks faster (respect `max_single_part_upload_size` instead of writing a block per each buffer size). Inefficiency mentioned in [#41754](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41754). [#42041](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42041) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Make thread ids in the process list and query_log unique to avoid waste. [#42180](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42180) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support skipping cache completely (both download to cache and reading cached data) in case the requested read range exceeds the threshold defined by cache setting `bypass_cache_threashold`, requires to be enabled with `enable_bypass_cache_with_threshold`). [#42418](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42418) ([Han Shukai](https://github.com/KinderRiven)). This helps on slow local disks.

#### Improvement
* Add setting `allow_implicit_no_password`: in combination with `allow_no_password` it forbids creating a user with no password unless `IDENTIFIED WITH no_password` is explicitly specified. [#41341](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41341) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Embedded Keeper will always start in the background allowing ClickHouse to start without achieving quorum. [#40991](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40991) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Made reestablishing a new connection to ZooKeeper more reactive in case of expiration of the previous one. Previously there was a task which spawns every minute by default and thus a table could be in readonly state for about this time. [#41092](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41092) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Now projections can be used with zero copy replication (zero-copy replication is a non-production feature). [#41147](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41147) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Support expression `(EXPLAIN SELECT ...)` in a subquery. Queries like `SELECT * FROM (EXPLAIN PIPELINE SELECT col FROM TABLE ORDER BY col)` became valid. [#40630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40630) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Allow changing `async_insert_max_data_size` or `async_insert_busy_timeout_ms` in scope of query. E.g. user wants to insert data rarely and she doesn't have access to the server config to tune default settings. [#40668](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40668) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Improvements for reading from remote filesystems, made threadpool size for reads/writes configurable. Closes [#41070](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41070). [#41011](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41011) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Support all combinators combination in WindowTransform/arratReduce*/initializeAggregation/aggregate functions versioning. Previously combinators like `ForEach/Resample/Map` didn't work in these places, using them led to exception like`State function ... inserts results into non-state column`. [#41107](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41107) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add function `tryDecrypt` that returns NULL when decrypt fails (e.g. decrypt with incorrect key) instead of throwing an exception. [#41206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41206) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Add the `unreserved_space` column to the `system.disks` table to check how much space is not taken by reservations per disk. [#41254](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41254) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Support s3 authorization headers in table function arguments. [#41261](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41261) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add support for MultiRead in Keeper and internal ZooKeeper client (this is an extension to ZooKeeper protocol, only available in ClickHouse Keeper). [#41410](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41410) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add support for decimal type comparing with floating point literal in IN operator. [#41544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41544) ([liang.huang](https://github.com/lhuang09287750)).
* Allow readable size values (like `1TB`) in cache config. [#41688](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41688) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* ClickHouse could cache stale DNS entries for some period of time (15 seconds by default) until the cache won't be updated asynchronously. During these periods ClickHouse can nevertheless try to establish a connection and produce errors. This behavior is fixed. [#41707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41707) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Add interactive history search with fzf-like utility (fzf/sk) for `clickhouse-client`/`clickhouse-local` (note you can use `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`/`SKIM_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` to additionally configure the behavior). [#41730](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41730) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Only allow clients connecting to a secure server with an invalid certificate only to proceed with the '--accept-certificate' flag. [#41743](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41743) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Add function `tryBase58Decode`, similar to the existing function `tryBase64Decode`. [#41824](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41824) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Improve feedback when replacing partition with different primary key. Fixes [#34798](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34798). [#41838](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41838) ([Salvatore](https://github.com/tbsal)).
* Fix parallel parsing: segmentator now checks `max_block_size`. This fixed memory overallocation in case of parallel parsing and small LIMIT. [#41852](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41852) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Don't add "TABLE_IS_DROPPED" exception to `system.errors` if it's happened during SELECT from a system table and was ignored. [#41908](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41908) ([AlfVII](https://github.com/AlfVII)).
* Improve option `enable_extended_results_for_datetime_functions` to return results of type DateTime64 for functions `toStartOfDay`, `toStartOfHour`, `toStartOfFifteenMinutes`, `toStartOfTenMinutes`, `toStartOfFiveMinutes`, `toStartOfMinute` and `timeSlot`. [#41910](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41910) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* Improve `DateTime` type inference for text formats. Now it respects setting `date_time_input_format` and doesn't try to infer datetimes from numbers as timestamps. Closes [#41389](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41389) Closes [#42206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42206). [#41912](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41912) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Remove confusing warning when inserting with `perform_ttl_move_on_insert` = false. [#41980](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41980) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Allow user to write `countState(*)` similar to `count(*)`. This closes [#9338](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9338). [#41983](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41983) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Fix `rankCorr` size overflow. [#42020](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42020) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Added an option to specify an arbitrary string as an environment name in the Sentry's config for more handy reports. [#42037](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42037) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Fix parsing out-of-range Date from CSV. [#42044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42044) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* `parseDataTimeBestEffort` now supports comma between date and time. Closes [#42038](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42038). [#42049](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42049) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Improved stale replica recovery process for `ReplicatedMergeTree`. If a lost replica has some parts which are absent from a healthy replica, but these parts should appear in the future according to the replication queue of the healthy replica, then the lost replica will keep such parts instead of detaching them. [#42134](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42134) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Add a possibility to use `Date32` arguments for date_diff function. Fix issue in date_diff function when using DateTime64 arguments with a start date before Unix epoch and end date after Unix epoch. [#42308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42308) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* When uploading big parts to Minio, 'Complete Multipart Upload' can take a long time. Minio sends heartbeats every 10 seconds (see https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/7198). But clickhouse times out earlier, because the default send/receive timeout is [set](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/cc24fcd6d5dfb67f5f66f5483e986bd1010ad9cf/src/IO/S3/PocoHTTPClient.cpp#L123) to 5 seconds. [#42321](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42321) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Fix rarely invalid cast of aggregate state types with complex types such as Decimal. This fixes [#42408](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42408). [#42417](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42417) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Allow to use `Date32` arguments for `dateName` function. [#42554](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42554) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* Now filters with NULL literals will be used during index analysis. [#34063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34063). [#41842](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41842) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Merge parts if every part in the range is older than a certain threshold. The threshold can be set by using `min_age_to_force_merge_seconds`. This closes [#35836](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35836). [#42423](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42423) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)). This is continuation of [#39550i](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39550) by [@fastio](https://github.com/fastio) who implemented most of the logic.
* Added new infrastructure for query analysis and planning under `allow_experimental_analyzer` setting. [#31796](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31796) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve the time to recover lost keeper connections. [#42541](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42541) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Add fuzzer for table definitions [#40096](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40096) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)). This represents the biggest advancement for ClickHouse testing in this year so far.
* Beta version of the ClickHouse Cloud service is released: [https://clickhouse.cloud/](https://clickhouse.cloud/). It provides the easiest way to use ClickHouse (even slightly easier than the single-command installation).
* Added support of WHERE clause generation to AST Fuzzer and possibility to add or remove ORDER BY and WHERE clause. [#38519](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38519) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Aarch64 binaries now require at least ARMv8.2, released in 2016. Most notably, this enables use of ARM LSE, i.e. native atomic operations. Also, CMake build option "NO_ARMV81_OR_HIGHER" has been added to allow compilation of binaries for older ARMv8.0 hardware, e.g. Raspberry Pi 4. [#41610](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41610) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Allow building ClickHouse with Musl (small changes after it was already supported but broken). [#41987](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41987) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add the `$CLICKHOUSE_CRONFILE` file checking to avoid running the `sed` command to get the file not found error on install. [#42081](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42081) ([Chun-Sheng, Li](https://github.com/peter279k)).
* Update cctz to `2022e` to support the new timezone changes. Palestine transitions are now Saturdays at 02:00. Simplify three Ukraine zones into one. Jordan and Syria switch from +02/+03 with DST to year-round +03. (https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tzdb/NEWS). This closes [#42252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42252). [#42327](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42327) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)). [#42273](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42273) ([Dom Del Nano](https://github.com/ddelnano)).
* Add Rust code support into ClickHouse with BLAKE3 hash-function library as an example. [#33435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33435) ([BoloniniD](https://github.com/BoloniniD)).

* Mutations were not cancelled properly on server shutdown or `SYSTEM STOP MERGES` query and cancellation might take long time, it's fixed. [#41699](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41699) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Fix wrong result of queries with `ORDER BY` or `GROUP BY` by columns from prefix of sorting key, wrapped into monotonic functions, with enable "read in order" optimization (settings `optimize_read_in_order` and `optimize_aggregation_in_order`). [#41701](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41701) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fix possible crash in `SELECT` from `Merge` table with enabled `optimize_monotonous_functions_in_order_by` setting. Fixes [#41269](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41269). [#41740](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41740) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Fixed "Part ... intersects part ..." error that might happen in extremely rare cases if replica was restarted just after detaching some part as broken. [#41741](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41741) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Don't allow to create or alter merge tree tables with column name `_row_exists`, which is reserved for lightweight delete. Fixed [#41716](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41716). [#41763](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41763) ([Jianmei Zhang](https://github.com/zhangjmruc)).

* 22.9 might fail to startup `ReplicatedMergeTree` table if that table was created by 20.3 or older version and was never altered, it's fixed. Fixes [#41742](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41742). [#41796](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41796) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* When the batch sending fails for some reason, it cannot be automatically recovered, and if it is not processed in time, it will lead to accumulation, and the printed error message will become longer and longer, which will cause the http thread to block. [#41813](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41813) ([zhongyuankai](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* Fix compact parts with compressed marks setting. Fixes [#41783](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41783) and [#41746](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41746). [#41823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41823) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Old versions of Replicated database don't have a special marker in [Zoo]Keeper. We need to check only whether the node contains come obscure data instead of special mark. [#41875](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41875) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Fix possible exception in fs cache. [#41884](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41884) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

[#42084](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42084) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* The maximum size of fetches for each table accidentally was set to 8 while the pool size could be bigger. Now the maximum size of fetches for table is equal to the pool size. [#42090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42090) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* A table might be shut down and a dictionary might be detached before checking if can be dropped without breaking dependencies between table, it's fixed. Fixes [#41982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41982). [#42106](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42106) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

* `ALTER UPDATE` of attached part (with columns different from table schema) could create an invalid `columns.txt` metadata on disk. Reading from such part could fail with errors or return invalid data. Fixes [#42161](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42161). [#42319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42319) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Setting `additional_table_filters` were not applied to `Distributed` storage. Fixes [#41692](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/41692). [#42322](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42322) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

* Fix unexpected table loading error when partition key contains alias function names during server upgrade. [#36379](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36379) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

### <a id="229"></a> ClickHouse release 22.9, 2022-09-22

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Upgrade from 20.3 and older to 22.9 and newer should be done through an intermediate version if there are any `ReplicatedMergeTree` tables, otherwise server with the new version will not start. [#40641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40641) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Remove the functions `accurate_Cast` and `accurate_CastOrNull` (they are different to `accurateCast` and `accurateCastOrNull` by underscore in the name and they are not affected by the value of `cast_keep_nullable` setting). These functions were undocumented, untested, unused, and unneeded. They appeared to be alive due to code generalization. [#40682](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40682) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a test to ensure that every new table function will be documented. See [#40649](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40649). Rename table function `MeiliSearch` to `meilisearch`. [#40709](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40709) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a test to ensure that every new function will be documented. See [#40649](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40649). The functions `lemmatize`, `synonyms`, `stem` were case-insensitive by mistake. Now they are case-sensitive. [#40711](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40711) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* For security and stability reasons, catboost models are no longer evaluated within the ClickHouse server. Instead, the evaluation is now
  done in the clickhouse-library-bridge, a separate process that loads the catboost library and communicates with the server process via
  HTTP. [#40897](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40897) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Make interpretation of YAML configs to be more conventional. [#41044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41044) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).

#### New Feature
* Support `insert_quorum = 'auto'` to use majority number. [#39970](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39970) ([Sachin](https://github.com/SachinSetiya)).
* Add embedded dashboards to ClickHouse server. This is a demo project about how to achieve 90% results with 1% effort using ClickHouse features. [#40461](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40461) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added new settings constraint writability kind `changeable_in_readonly`. [#40631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40631) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Add support for `INTERSECT DISTINCT` and `EXCEPT DISTINCT`. [#40792](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40792) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Add new input/output format `JSONObjectEachRow` - Support import for formats `JSON/JSONCompact/JSONColumnsWithMetadata`. Add new setting `input_format_json_validate_types_from_metadata` that controls whether we should check if data types from metadata match data types from the header. - Add new setting `input_format_json_validate_utf8`, when it's enabled, all `JSON` formats will validate UTF-8 sequences. It will be disabled by default. Note that this setting doesn't influence output formats `JSON/JSONCompact/JSONColumnsWithMetadata`, they always validate utf8 sequences (this exception was made because of compatibility reasons). - Add new setting `input_format_json_read_numbers_as_strings ` that allows to parse numbers in String column, the setting is disabled by default. - Add new setting `output_format_json_quote_decimals` that allows to output decimals in double quotes, disabled by default. - Allow to parse decimals in double quotes during data import. [#40910](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40910) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Query parameters supported in DESCRIBE TABLE query. [#40952](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40952) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Add support to Parquet Time32/64 by converting it into DateTime64. Parquet time32/64 represents time elapsed since midnight, while DateTime32/64 represents an actual unix timestamp. Conversion simply offsets from `0`. [#41333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41333) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Implement set operations on Apache Datasketches. [#39919](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39919) ([Fangyuan Deng](https://github.com/pzhdfy)). Note: there is no point of using Apache Datasketches, they are inferiour than ClickHouse and only make sense for integration with other systems.
* Allow recording errors to specified file while reading text formats (`CSV`, `TSV`). [#40516](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40516) ([zjial](https://github.com/zjial)).

* Virtual filesystem over s3 will use random object names split into multiple path prefixes for better performance on AWS. [#40968](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40968) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Account `max_block_size` value while producing single-level aggregation results. Allows to execute following query plan steps using more threads. [#39138](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39138) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Software prefetching is used in aggregation to speed up operations with hash tables. Controlled by the setting `enable_software_prefetch_in_aggregation`, enabled by default. [#39304](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39304) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Better support of `optimize_read_in_order` in case when some of sorting key columns are always constant after applying `WHERE` clause. E.g. query like `SELECT ... FROM table WHERE a = 'x' ORDER BY a, b`, where `table` has storage definition: `MergeTree ORDER BY (a, b)`. [#38715](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38715) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Filter joined streams for `full_sorting_join` by each other before sorting. [#39418](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39418) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* LZ4 decompression optimised by skipping empty literals processing. [#40142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40142) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Speedup backup process using native `copy` when possible instead of copying through `clickhouse-server` memory. [#40395](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40395) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Do not obtain storage snapshot for each INSERT block (slightly improves performance). [#40638](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40638) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Implement batch processing for aggregate functions with multiple nullable arguments. [#41058](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41058) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Speed up reading UniquesHashSet (`uniqState` from disk for example). [#41089](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41089) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

* Enable the vectorscan library on ARM, this speeds up regexp evaluation. [#41033](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41033) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Upgrade vectorscan to 5.4.8 which has many performance optimizations to speed up regexp evaluation. [#41270](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41270) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Fix incorrect fallback to skip the local filesystem cache for VFS (like S3) which happened on very high concurrency level. [#40420](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40420) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* If row policy filter is always false, return empty result immediately without reading any data. This closes [#24012](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/24012). [#40740](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40740) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Parallel hash JOIN for Float data types might be suboptimal. Make it better. [#41183](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41183) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Improvement
* During startup and ATTACH call, `ReplicatedMergeTree` tables will be readonly until the ZooKeeper connection is made and the setup is finished. [#40148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40148) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add `enable_extended_results_for_datetime_functions` option to return results of type Date32 for functions toStartOfYear, toStartOfISOYear, toStartOfQuarter, toStartOfMonth, toStartOfWeek, toMonday and toLastDayOfMonth when argument is Date32 or DateTime64, otherwise results of Date type are returned. For compatibility reasons default value is ‘0’. [#41214](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41214) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* For security and stability reasons, CatBoost models are no longer evaluated within the ClickHouse server. Instead, the evaluation is now done in the clickhouse-library-bridge, a separate process that loads the catboost library and communicates with the server process via HTTP. Function `modelEvaluate()` was replaced by `catboostEvaluate()`. [#40897](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40897) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)). [#39629](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39629) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

### <a id="228"></a> ClickHouse release 22.8, 2022-08-18

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Extended range of `Date32` and `DateTime64` to support dates from the year 1900 to 2299. In previous versions, the supported interval was only from the year 1925 to 2283. The implementation is using the proleptic Gregorian calendar (which is conformant with [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601):2004 (clause 3.2.1 The Gregorian calendar)) instead of accounting for historical transitions from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. This change affects implementation-specific behavior for out-of-range arguments. E.g. if in previous versions the value of `1899-01-01` was clamped to `1925-01-01`, in the new version it will be clamped to `1900-01-01`. It changes the behavior of rounding with `toStartOfInterval` if you pass `INTERVAL 3 QUARTER` up to one quarter because the intervals are counted from an implementation-specific point of time. Closes [#28216](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28216), improves [#38393](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38393). [#39425](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39425) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* Now, all relevant dictionary sources respect `remote_url_allow_hosts` setting. It was already done for HTTP, Cassandra, Redis. Added ClickHouse, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL. Host is checked only for dictionaries created from DDL. [#39184](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39184) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Prebuilt ClickHouse x86 binaries now require support for AVX instructions, i.e. a CPU not older than Intel Sandy Bridge / AMD Bulldozer, both released in 2011. [#39000](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39000) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Make the remote filesystem cache composable, allow not to evict certain files (regarding idx, mrk, ..), delete old cache version. Now it is possible to configure cache over Azure blob storage disk, over Local disk, over StaticWeb disk, etc. This PR is marked backward incompatible because cache configuration changes and in order for cache to work need to update the config file. Old cache will still be used with new configuration. The server will startup fine with the old cache configuration. Closes https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36140. Closes https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37889. ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)). [#36171](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36171))

#### New Feature
* Support SQL standard DELETE FROM syntax on merge tree tables and lightweight delete implementation for merge tree families. [#37893](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37893) ([Jianmei Zhang](https://github.com/zhangjmruc)) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)). Note: this new feature does not make ClickHouse an HTAP DBMS.
* Query parameters can be set in interactive mode as `SET param_abc = 'def'` and transferred via the native protocol as settings. [#39906](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39906) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Quota key can be set in the native protocol ([Yakov Olkhovsky](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39874)).
* Added a setting `exact_rows_before_limit` (0/1). When enabled, ClickHouse will provide exact value for `rows_before_limit_at_least` statistic, but with the cost that the data before limit will have to be read completely. This closes [#6613](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6613). [#25333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/25333) ([kevin wan](https://github.com/MaxWk)).
* Added support for parallel distributed insert select with `s3Cluster` table function into tables with `Distributed` and `Replicated` engine [#34670](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34670). [#39107](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39107) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Add new settings to control schema inference from text formats: - `input_format_try_infer_dates` - try infer dates from strings. - `input_format_try_infer_datetimes` - try infer datetimes from strings. - `input_format_try_infer_integers` - try infer `Int64` instead of `Float64`. - `input_format_json_try_infer_numbers_from_strings` - try infer numbers from json strings in JSON formats. [#39186](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39186) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* An option to provide JSON formatted log output. The purpose is to allow easier ingestion and query in log analysis tools. [#39277](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39277) ([Mallik Hassan](https://github.com/SadiHassan)).
* Add function `nowInBlock` which allows getting the current time during long-running and continuous queries. Closes [#39522](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39522). Notes: there are no functions `now64InBlock` neither `todayInBlock`. [#39533](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39533) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add ability to specify settings for an `executable()` table function. [#39681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39681) ([Constantine Peresypkin](https://github.com/pkit)).
* Implemented automatic conversion of database engine from `Ordinary` to `Atomic`. Create empty `convert_ordinary_to_atomic` file in `flags` directory and all `Ordinary` databases will be converted automatically on next server start. Resolves [#39546](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39546). [#39933](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39933) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Support `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE '...' AND STDOUT`. [#37490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37490). [#39054](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39054) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add formats `PrettyMonoBlock`, `PrettyNoEscapesMonoBlock`, `PrettyCompactNoEscapes`, `PrettyCompactNoEscapesMonoBlock`, `PrettySpaceNoEscapes`, `PrettySpaceMonoBlock`, `PrettySpaceNoEscapesMonoBlock`. [#39646](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39646) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Improved memory usage during memory efficient merging of aggregation results. [#39429](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39429) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Added concurrency control logic to limit total number of concurrent threads created by queries. [#37558](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37558) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)). Add `concurrent_threads_soft_limit parameter` to increase performance in case of high QPS by means of limiting total number of threads for all queries. [#37285](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37285) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* Add `SLRU` cache policy for uncompressed cache and marks cache. ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)). [#34651](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34651) ([alexX512](https://github.com/alexX512)). Decoupling local cache function and cache algorithm [#38048](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38048) ([Han Shukai](https://github.com/KinderRiven)).
* Intel® In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (Intel® IAA) is a hardware accelerator available in the upcoming generation of Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors ("Sapphire Rapids"). Its goal is to speed up common operations in analytics like data (de)compression and filtering. ClickHouse gained the new "DeflateQpl" compression codec which utilizes the Intel® IAA offloading technology to provide a high-performance DEFLATE implementation. The codec uses the [Intel® Query Processing Library (QPL)](https://github.com/intel/qpl) which abstracts access to the hardware accelerator, respectively to a software fallback in case the hardware accelerator is not available. DEFLATE provides in general higher compression rates than ClickHouse's LZ4 default codec, and as a result, offers less disk I/O and lower main memory consumption. [#36654](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36654) ([jasperzhu](https://github.com/jinjunzh)). [#39494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39494) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* `DISTINCT` in order with `ORDER BY`: Deduce way to sort based on input stream sort description. Skip sorting if input stream is already sorted. [#38719](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38719) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)). Improve memory usage (significantly) and query execution time + use `DistinctSortedChunkTransform` for final distinct when `DISTINCT` columns match `ORDER BY` columns, but rename to `DistinctSortedStreamTransform` in `EXPLAIN PIPELINE` → this improves memory usage significantly + remove unnecessary allocations in hot loop in `DistinctSortedChunkTransform`. [#39432](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39432) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)). Use `DistinctSortedTransform` only when sort description is applicable to DISTINCT columns, otherwise fall back to ordinary DISTINCT implementation + it allows making less checks during `DistinctSortedTransform` execution. [#39528](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39528) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)). Fix: `DistinctSortedTransform` didn't take advantage of sorting. It never cleared HashSet since clearing_columns were detected incorrectly (always empty). So, it basically worked as ordinary `DISTINCT` (`DistinctTransform`). The fix reduces memory usage significantly. [#39538](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39538) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Use local node as first priority to get structure of remote table when executing `cluster` and similar table functions. [#39440](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39440) ([Mingliang Pan](https://github.com/liangliangpan)).
* Optimize filtering by numeric columns with AVX512VBMI2 compress store. [#39633](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39633) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)). For systems with AVX512 VBMI2, this PR improves performance by ca. 6% for SSB benchmark queries queries 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 (SF=100). Tested on Intel Icelake Xeon 8380 * 2 socket. [#40033](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40033) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Optimize index analysis with functional expressions in multi-thread scenario. [#39812](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39812) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).
* Optimizations for complex queries: Don't visit the AST for UDFs if none are registered. [#40069](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40069) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)). Optimize CurrentMemoryTracker alloc and free. [#40078](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40078) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improved Base58 encoding/decoding. [#39292](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39292) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Improve bytes to bits mask transform for SSE/AVX/AVX512. [#39586](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39586) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).

#### Improvement
* Normalize `AggregateFunction` types and state representations because optimizations like [#35788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35788) will treat `count(not null columns)` as `count()`, which might confuses distributed interpreters with the following error : `Conversion from AggregateFunction(count) to AggregateFunction(count, Int64) is not supported`. [#39420](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39420) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)). The functions with identical states can be used in materialized views interchangeably.
* Rework and simplify the `system.backups` table, remove the `internal` column, allow user to set the ID of operation, add columns `num_files`, `uncompressed_size`, `compressed_size`, `start_time`, `end_time`. [#39503](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39503) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Improved structure of DDL query result table for `Replicated` database (separate columns with shard and replica name, more clear status) - `CREATE TABLE ... ON CLUSTER` queries can be normalized on initiator first if `distributed_ddl_entry_format_version` is set to 3 (default value). It means that `ON CLUSTER` queries may not work if initiator does not belong to the cluster that specified in query. Fixes [#37318](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37318), [#39500](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39500) - Ignore `ON CLUSTER` clause if database is `Replicated` and cluster name equals to database name. Related to [#35570](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35570) - Miscellaneous minor fixes for `Replicated` database engine - Check metadata consistency when starting up `Replicated` database, start replica recovery in case of mismatch of local metadata and metadata in Keeper. Resolves [#24880](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/24880). [#37198](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37198) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Add result_rows and result_bytes to progress reports (`X-ClickHouse-Summary`). [#39567](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39567) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improve primary key analysis for MergeTree. [#25563](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/25563) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* `timeSlots` now works with DateTime64; subsecond duration and slot size available when working with DateTime64. [#37951](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37951) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Added support of `LEFT SEMI` and `LEFT ANTI` direct join with `EmbeddedRocksDB` tables. [#38956](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38956) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Add profile events for fsync operations. [#39179](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39179) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add the second argument to the ordinary function `file(path[, default])`, which function returns in the case when a file does not exists. [#39218](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39218) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Some small fixes for reading via http, allow to retry partial content in case if 200 OK. [#39244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39244) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Support queries `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ... (<list of columns>) AS ...`. [#39462](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39462) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add support of `!`/`*` (exclamation/asterisk) in custom TLDs (`cutToFirstSignificantSubdomainCustom()`/`cutToFirstSignificantSubdomainCustomWithWWW()`/`firstSignificantSubdomainCustom()`). [#39496](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39496) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add support for TLS connections to NATS. Implements [#39525](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39525). [#39527](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39527) ([Constantine Peresypkin](https://github.com/pkit)).
* `clickhouse-obfuscator` (a tool for database obfuscation for testing and load generation) now has the new `--save` and `--load` parameters to work with pre-trained models. This closes [#39534](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39534). [#39541](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39541) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix incorrect behavior of log rotation during restart. [#39558](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39558) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Fix building aggregate projections when external aggregation is on. Mark as improvement because the case is rare and there exists easy workaround to fix it via changing settings. This fixes [#39667](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39667) . [#39671](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39671) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Allow to execute hash functions with arguments of type `Map`. [#39685](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39685) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Add a configuration parameter to hide addresses in stack traces. It may improve security a little but generally, it is harmful and should not be used. [#39690](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39690) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Change the prefix size of AggregateFunctionDistinct to make sure nested function data memory segment is aligned. [#39696](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39696) ([Pxl](https://github.com/BiteTheDDDDt)).
* Properly escape credentials passed to the `clickhouse-diagnostic` tool. [#39707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39707) ([Dale McDiarmid](https://github.com/gingerwizard)).
* ClickHouse Keeper improvement: create a snapshot on exit. It can be controlled with the config `keeper_server.create_snapshot_on_exit`, `true` by default. [#39755](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39755) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Support primary key analysis for `row_policy_filter` and `additional_filter`. It also helps fix issues like [#37454](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37454) . [#39826](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39826) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Fix two usability issues in Play UI: - it was non-pixel-perfect on iPad due to parasitic border radius and margins; - the progress indication did not display after the first query. This closes [#39957](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39957). This closes [#39960](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39960). [#39961](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39961) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Play UI: add row numbers; add cell selection on click; add hysteresis for table cells. [#39962](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39962) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Play UI: recognize tab key in textarea, but at the same time don't mess up with tab navigation. [#40053](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40053) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The client will show server-side elapsed time. This is important for the performance comparison of ClickHouse services in remote datacenters. This closes [#38070](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38070). See also [this](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickBench/blob/main/hardware/benchmark-cloud.sh#L37) for motivation. [#39968](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39968) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Adds `parseDateTime64BestEffortUS`, `parseDateTime64BestEffortUSOrNull`, `parseDateTime64BestEffortUSOrZero` functions, closing [#37492](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37492). [#40015](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40015) ([Tanya Bragin](https://github.com/tbragin)).
* Extend the `system.processors_profile_log` with more information such as input rows. [#40121](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40121) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Display server-side time in `clickhouse-benchmark` by default if it is available (since ClickHouse version 22.8). This is needed to correctly compare the performance of clouds. This behavior can be changed with the new `--client-side-time` command line option. Change the `--randomize` command line option from `--randomize 1` to the form without argument. [#40193](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40193) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add counters (ProfileEvents) for cases when query complexity limitation has been set and has reached (a separate counter for `overflow_mode` = `break` and `throw`). For example, if you have set up `max_rows_to_read` with `read_overflow_mode = 'break'`, looking at the value of `OverflowBreak` counter will allow distinguishing incomplete results. [#40205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40205) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix memory accounting in case of "Memory limit exceeded" errors (previously [peak] memory usage was takes failed allocations into account). [#40249](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40249) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add metrics for filesystem cache: `FilesystemCacheSize` and `FilesystemCacheElements`. [#40260](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40260) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Support hadoop secure RPC transfer (hadoop.rpc.protection=privacy and hadoop.rpc.protection=integrity). [#39411](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39411) ([michael1589](https://github.com/michael1589)).
* Avoid continuously growing memory consumption of pattern cache when using functions multi(Fuzzy)Match(Any|AllIndices|AnyIndex)(). [#40264](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/40264) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* [ClickFiddle](https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/): A new tool for testing ClickHouse versions in read/write mode (**Igor Baliuk**).
* ClickHouse binary is made self-extracting [#35775](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35775) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy, Arthur Filatenkov](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Update tzdata to 2022b to support the new timezone changes. See https://github.com/google/cctz/pull/226. Chile's 2022 DST start is delayed from September 4 to September 11. Iran plans to stop observing DST permanently, after it falls back on 2022-09-21. There are corrections of the historical time zone of Asia/Tehran in the year 1977: Iran adopted standard time in 1935, not 1946. In 1977 it observed DST from 03-21 23:00 to 10-20 24:00; its 1978 transitions were on 03-24 and 08-05, not 03-20 and 10-20; and its spring 1979 transition was on 05-27, not 03-21 (https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tzdb/NEWS). ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Former packages used to install systemd.service file to `/etc`. The files there are marked as `conf` and are not cleaned out, and not updated automatically. This PR cleans them out. [#39323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39323) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Ensure LSan is effective. [#39430](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39430) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* TSAN has issues with clang-14 (https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1552, https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1540), so here we build the TSAN binaries with clang-15. [#39450](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39450) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Remove the option to build ClickHouse tools as separate executable programs. This fixes [#37847](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37847). [#39520](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39520) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### <a id="227"></a> ClickHouse release 22.7, 2022-07-21

#### Upgrade Notes
* Enable setting `enable_positional_arguments` by default. It allows queries like `SELECT ... ORDER BY 1, 2` where 1, 2 are the references to the select clause. If you need to return the old behavior, disable this setting. [#38204](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38204) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Disable `format_csv_allow_single_quotes` by default. See [#37096](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37096). ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* `Ordinary` database engine and old storage definition syntax for `*MergeTree` tables are deprecated. By default it's not possible to create new databases with `Ordinary` engine. If `system` database has `Ordinary` engine it will be automatically converted to `Atomic` on server startup. There are settings to keep old behavior (`allow_deprecated_database_ordinary` and `allow_deprecated_syntax_for_merge_tree`), but these settings may be removed in future releases. [#38335](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38335) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Force rewriting comma join to inner by default (set default value `cross_to_inner_join_rewrite = 2`). To have old behavior set `cross_to_inner_join_rewrite = 1`. [#39326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39326) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)). If you will face any incompatibilities, you can turn this setting back.

#### New Feature
* Support expressions with window functions. Closes [#19857](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/19857). [#37848](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37848) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Add new `direct` join algorithm for `EmbeddedRocksDB` tables, see [#33582](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33582). [#35363](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35363) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Added full sorting merge join algorithm. [#35796](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35796) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).

* Implement table function `mongodb`. Allow writes into `MongoDB` storage / table function. [#37213](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37213) ([aaapetrenko](https://github.com/aaapetrenko)). ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii))
* Add `SQLInsert` output format. Closes [#38441](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38441). [#38477](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38477) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Introduced settings `additional_table_filters`. Using this setting, you can specify additional filtering condition for a table which will be applied directly after reading. Example: `select number, x, y from (select number from system.numbers limit 5) f any left join (select x, y from table_1) s on f.number = s.x settings additional_table_filters={'system.numbers : 'number != 3', 'table_1' : 'x != 2'}`. Introduced setting `additional_result_filter` which specifies additional filtering condition for query result. Closes [#37918](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37918). [#38475](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38475) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

* Support `parseTimeDelta` function. It can be used like ` ;-+,:` can be used as separators, eg. `1yr-2mo`, `2m:6s`: `SELECT parseTimeDelta('1yr-2mo-4w + 12 days, 3 hours : 1 minute ; 33 seconds')`. [#39071](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39071) ([jiahui-97](https://github.com/jiahui-97)).
* Added `CREATE TABLE ... EMPTY AS SELECT` query. It automatically deduces table structure from the SELECT query, but does not fill the table after creation. Resolves [#38049](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38049). [#38272](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38272) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Added options to limit IO operations with remote storage: `max_remote_read_network_bandwidth_for_server` and `max_remote_write_network_bandwidth_for_server`. [#39095](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39095) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Add `group_by_use_nulls` setting to make aggregation key columns nullable in the case of ROLLUP, CUBE and GROUPING SETS. Closes [#37359](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37359). [#38642](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38642) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).

* Functions `multiMatchAny`, `multiMatchAnyIndex`, `multiMatchAllIndices` and their fuzzy variants now accept non-const pattern array argument. [#38485](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38485) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)). SQL function `multiSearchAllPositions` now accepts non-const needle arguments. [#39167](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39167) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Add a setting `zstd_window_log_max` to configure max memory usage on zstd decoding when importing external files. Closes [#35693](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35693). [#37015](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37015) ([wuxiaobai24](https://github.com/wuxiaobai24)).
* Add `send_logs_source_regexp` setting. Send server text logs with specified regexp to match log source name. Empty means all sources. [#39161](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/39161) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Support `ALTER` for `Hive` tables. [#38214](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38214) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Support `isNullable` function. This function checks whether it's argument is nullable and return 1 or 0. Closes [#38611](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38611). [#38841](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38841) ([lokax](https://github.com/lokax)).
* Added functions for base58 encoding/decoding. [#38159](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38159) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).

It handles both creation and closing (via COMMIT if the query succeeded or ROLLBACK if it didn't) of the transaction automatically. [#38344](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38344) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Distinct optimization for sorted columns. Use specialized distinct transformation in case input stream is sorted by column(s) in distinct. Optimization can be applied to pre-distinct, final distinct, or both. Initial implementation by @dimarub2000. [#37803](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37803) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Improve performance of `ORDER BY`, `MergeTree` merges, window functions using batch version of `BinaryHeap`. [#38022](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38022) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* More parallel execution for queries with `FINAL` [#36396](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36396) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).

### <a id="226"></a> ClickHouse release 22.6, 2022-06-16

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Remove support for octal number literals in SQL. In previous versions they were parsed as Float64. [#37765](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37765) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Changes how settings using `seconds` as type are parsed to support floating point values (for example: `max_execution_time=0.5`). Infinity or NaN values will throw an exception. [#37187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37187) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Changed format of binary serialization of columns of experimental type `Object`. New format is more convenient to implement by third-party clients. [#37482](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37482) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Turn on setting `output_format_json_named_tuples_as_objects` by default. It allows to serialize named tuples as JSON objects in JSON formats. [#37756](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37756) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* LIKE patterns with trailing escape symbol ('\\') are now disallowed (as mandated by the SQL standard). [#37764](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37764) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* If you run different ClickHouse versions on a cluster with AArch64 CPU or mix AArch64 and amd64 on a cluster, and use distributed queries with GROUP BY multiple keys of fixed-size type that fit in 256 bits but don't fit in 64 bits, and the size of the result is huge, the data will not be fully aggregated in the result of these queries during upgrade. Workaround: upgrade with downtime instead of a rolling upgrade.

#### New Feature
* Add `GROUPING` function. It allows to disambiguate the records in the queries with `ROLLUP`, `CUBE` or `GROUPING SETS`. Closes [#19426](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/19426). [#37163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37163) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* A new codec [FPC](https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/papers/dcc07a.pdf) algorithm for floating point data compression. [#37553](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37553) ([Mikhail Guzov](https://github.com/koloshmet)).
* Add new columnar JSON formats: `JSONColumns`, `JSONCompactColumns`, `JSONColumnsWithMetadata`. Closes [#36338](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36338) Closes [#34509](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34509). [#36975](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36975) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Added open telemetry traces visualizing tool based on d3js. [#37810](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37810) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Support INSERTs into `system.zookeeper` table. Closes [#22130](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22130). [#37596](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37596) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Support non-constant pattern argument for `LIKE`, `ILIKE` and `match` functions. [#37251](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37251) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Executable user defined functions now support parameters. Example: `SELECT test_function(parameters)(arguments)`. Closes [#37578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37578). [#37720](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37720) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Add `merge_reason` column to system.part_log table. [#36912](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36912) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Add support for Maps and Records in Avro format. Add new setting `input_format_avro_null_as_default ` that allow to insert null as default in Avro format. Closes [#18925](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/18925) Closes [#37378](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37378) Closes [#32899](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32899). [#37525](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37525) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add `clickhouse-disks` tool to introspect and operate on virtual filesystems configured for ClickHouse. [#36060](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36060) ([Artyom Yurkov](https://github.com/Varinara)).
* Adds H3 unidirectional edge functions. [#36843](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36843) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add support for calculating [hashids](https://hashids.org/) from unsigned integers. [#37013](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37013) ([Michael Nutt](https://github.com/mnutt)).
* Explicit `SALT` specification is allowed for `CREATE USER <user> IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_hash`. [#37377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37377) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Add two new settings `input_format_csv_skip_first_lines/input_format_tsv_skip_first_lines` to allow skipping specified number of lines in the beginning of the file in CSV/TSV formats. [#37537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37537) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* `showCertificate` function shows current server's SSL certificate. [#37540](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37540) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* HTTP source for Data Dictionaries in Named Collections is supported. [#37581](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37581) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Added a new window function `nonNegativeDerivative(metric_column, timestamp_column[, INTERVAL x SECOND])`. [#37628](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37628) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Implemented changing the comment for `ReplicatedMergeTree` tables. [#37416](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37416) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk)).
* Added `SYSTEM UNFREEZE` query that deletes the whole backup regardless if the corresponding table is deleted or not. [#36424](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36424) ([Vadim Volodin](https://github.com/PolyProgrammist)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Enables `POPULATE` for `WINDOW VIEW`. [#36945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36945) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider)).
* `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY QUERY` support for `WINDOW VIEW`. [#37188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37188) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider)).
* This PR changes the behavior of the `ENGINE` syntax in `WINDOW VIEW`, to make it like in `MATERIALIZED VIEW`. [#37214](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37214) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Added numerous optimizations for ARM NEON [#38093](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38093)([Daniel Kutenin](https://github.com/danlark1)), ([Alexandra Pilipyuk](https://github.com/chalice19)) Note: if you run different ClickHouse versions on a cluster with ARM CPU and use distributed queries with GROUP BY multiple keys of fixed-size type that fit in 256 bits but don't fit in 64 bits, the result of the aggregation query will be wrong during upgrade. Workaround: upgrade with downtime instead of a rolling upgrade.
* Improve performance and memory usage for select of subset of columns for formats Native, Protobuf, CapnProto, JSONEachRow, TSKV, all formats with suffixes WithNames/WithNamesAndTypes. Previously while selecting only subset of columns from files in these formats all columns were read and stored in memory. Now only required columns are read. This PR enables setting `input_format_skip_unknown_fields` by default, because otherwise in case of select of subset of columns exception will be thrown. [#37192](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37192) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Now more filters can be pushed down for join. [#37472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37472) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Load marks for only necessary columns when reading wide parts. [#36879](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36879) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* Improved performance of aggregation in case, when sparse columns (can be enabled by experimental setting `ratio_of_defaults_for_sparse_serialization` in `MergeTree` tables) are used as arguments in aggregate functions. [#37617](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37617) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Optimize function `COALESCE` with two arguments. [#37666](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37666) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Replace `multiIf` to `if` in case when `multiIf` has only one condition, because function `if` is more performant. [#37695](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37695) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improve performance of `dictGetDescendants`, `dictGetChildren` functions, create temporary parent to children hierarchical index per query, not per function call during query. Allow to specify `BIDIRECTIONAL` for `HIERARHICAL` attributes, dictionary will maintain parent to children index in memory, that way functions `dictGetDescendants`, `dictGetChildren` will not create temporary index per query. Closes [#32481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32481). [#37148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37148) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Aggregates state destruction now may be posted on a thread pool. For queries with LIMIT and big state it provides significant speedup, e.g. `select uniq(number) from numbers_mt(1e7) group by number limit 100` became around 2.5x faster. [#37855](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37855) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Improve sort performance by single column. [#37195](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37195) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of single column sorting using sorting queue specializations. [#37990](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37990) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improved performance on array norm and distance functions 2x-4x times. [#37394](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37394) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Improve performance of number comparison functions using dynamic dispatch. [#37399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37399) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of ORDER BY with LIMIT. [#37481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37481) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of `hasAll` function using dynamic dispatch infrastructure. [#37484](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37484) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of `greatCircleAngle`, `greatCircleDistance`, `geoDistance` functions. [#37524](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37524) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of insert into MergeTree if there are multiple columns in ORDER BY. [#35762](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35762) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Fix excessive CPU usage in background when there are a lot of tables. [#38028](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38028) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of `not` function using dynamic dispatch. [#38058](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38058) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Optimized the internal caching of re2 patterns which occur e.g. in LIKE and MATCH functions. [#37544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37544) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Improve filter bitmask generator function all in one with AVX-512 instructions. [#37588](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37588) ([yaqi-zhao](https://github.com/yaqi-zhao)).
* Apply read method `threadpool` for Hive integration engine. This will significantly speed up reading. [#36328](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36328) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* When all the columns to read are partition keys, construct columns by the file's row number without real reading the Hive file. [#37103](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37103) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Support multi disks for caching hive files. [#37279](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37279) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Limiting the maximum cache usage per query can effectively prevent cache pool contamination. [Related Issues](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28961). [#37859](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37859) ([Han Shukai](https://github.com/KinderRiven)).
* Currently clickhouse directly downloads all remote files to the local cache (even if they are only read once), which will frequently cause IO of the local hard disk. In some scenarios, these IOs may not be necessary and may easily cause negative optimization. As shown in the figure below, when we run SSB Q1-Q4, the performance of the cache has caused negative optimization. [#37516](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37516) ([Han Shukai](https://github.com/KinderRiven)).
* Allow to prune the list of files via virtual columns such as `_file` and `_path` when reading from S3. This is for [#37174](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37174) , [#23494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23494). [#37356](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37356) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* In function: CompressedWriteBuffer::nextImpl(), there is an unnecessary write-copy step that would happen frequently during inserting data. Below shows the differentiation with this patch: - Before: 1. Compress "working_buffer" into "compressed_buffer" 2. write-copy into "out" - After: Directly Compress "working_buffer" into "out". [#37242](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37242) ([jasperzhu](https://github.com/jinjunzh)).

#### Improvement
* Support types with non-standard defaults in ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS. Closes [#37360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37360). [#37667](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37667) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Fix stack traces collection on ARM. Closes [#37044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37044). Closes [#15638](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15638). [#37797](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37797) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Client will try every IP address returned by DNS resolution until successful connection. [#37273](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37273) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Allow to use String type instead of Binary in Arrow/Parquet/ORC formats. This PR introduces 3 new settings for it: `output_format_arrow_string_as_string`, `output_format_parquet_string_as_string`, `output_format_orc_string_as_string`. Default value for all settings is `false`. [#37327](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37327) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Apply setting `input_format_max_rows_to_read_for_schema_inference` for all read rows in total from all files in globs. Previously setting `input_format_max_rows_to_read_for_schema_inference` was applied for each file in glob separately and in case of huge number of nulls we could read first `input_format_max_rows_to_read_for_schema_inference` rows from each file and get nothing. Also increase default value for this setting to 25000. [#37332](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37332) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add separate `CLUSTER` grant (and `access_control_improvements.on_cluster_queries_require_cluster_grant` configuration directive, for backward compatibility, default to `false`). [#35767](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35767) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added support for schema inference for `hdfsCluster`. [#35812](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35812) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Implement `least_used` load balancing algorithm for disks inside volume (multi disk configuration). [#36686](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36686) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Modify the HTTP Endpoint to return the full stats under the `X-ClickHouse-Summary` header when `send_progress_in_http_headers=0` (before it would return all zeros). - Modify the HTTP Endpoint to return `X-ClickHouse-Exception-Code` header when progress has been sent before (`send_progress_in_http_headers=1`) - Modify the HTTP Endpoint to return `HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` (408) instead of `HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (500) on `TIMEOUT_EXCEEDED` errors. [#36884](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36884) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Allow a user to inspect grants from granted roles. [#36941](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36941) ([nvartolomei](https://github.com/nvartolomei)).
* Do not calculate an integral numerically but use CDF functions instead. This will speed up execution and will increase the precision. This fixes [#36714](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36714). [#36953](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36953) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Add default implementation for Nothing in functions. Now most of the functions will return column with type Nothing in case one of it's arguments is Nothing. It also solves problem with functions like arrayMap/arrayFilter and similar when they have empty array as an argument. Previously queries like `select arrayMap(x -> 2 * x, []);` failed because function inside lambda cannot work with type `Nothing`, now such queries return empty array with type `Array(Nothing)`. Also add support for arrays of nullable types in functions like arrayFilter/arrayFill. Previously, queries like `select arrayFilter(x -> x % 2, [1, NULL])` failed, now they work (if the result of lambda is NULL, then this value won't be included in the result). Closes [#37000](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37000). [#37048](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37048) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Now if a shard has local replica we create a local plan and a plan to read from all remote replicas. They have shared initiator which coordinates reading. [#37204](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37204) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Do no longer abort server startup if configuration option "mark_cache_size" is not explicitly set. [#37326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37326) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Allows providing `NULL`/`NOT NULL` right after type in column declaration. [#37337](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37337) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* optimize file segment PARTIALLY_DOWNLOADED get read buffer. [#37338](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37338) ([xiedeyantu](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Try to improve short circuit functions processing to fix problems with stress tests. [#37384](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37384) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Closes [#37395](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37395). [#37415](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37415) ([Memo](https://github.com/Joeywzr)).
* Fix extremely rare deadlock during part fetch in zero-copy replication. Fixes [#37423](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/37423). [#37424](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37424) ([metahys](https://github.com/metahys)).
* Don't allow to create storage with unknown data format. [#37450](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37450) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Set `global_memory_usage_overcommit_max_wait_microseconds` default value to 5 seconds. Add info about `OvercommitTracker` to OOM exception message. Add `MemoryOvercommitWaitTimeMicroseconds` profile event. [#37460](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37460) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Do not display `-0.0` CPU time in clickhouse-client. It can appear due to rounding errors. This closes [#38003](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38003). This closes [#38038](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38038). [#38064](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38064) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Play UI: Keep controls in place when the page is scrolled horizontally. This makes edits comfortable even if the table is wide and it was scrolled far to the right. The feature proposed by Maksym Tereshchenko from CaspianDB. [#37470](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37470) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Modify query div in play.html to be extendable beyond 20% height. In case of very long queries it is helpful to extend the textarea element, only today, since the div is fixed height, the extended textarea hides the data div underneath. With this fix, extending the textarea element will push the data div down/up such the extended textarea won't hide it. Also, keeps query box width 100% even when the user adjusting the size of the query textarea. [#37488](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37488) ([guyco87](https://github.com/guyco87)).
* Added `ProfileEvents` for introspection of type of written (inserted or merged) parts (`Inserted{Wide/Compact/InMemory}Parts`, `MergedInto{Wide/Compact/InMemory}Parts`.

* More precise result of the `dumpColumnStructure` miscellaneous function in presence of LowCardinality or Sparse columns. In previous versions, these functions were converting the argument to a full column before returning the result. This is needed to provide an answer in [#6935](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6935). [#37633](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37633) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Add implicit grants with grant option too. For example `GRANT CREATE TABLE ON test.* TO A WITH GRANT OPTION` now allows `A` to execute `GRANT CREATE VIEW ON test.* TO B`. [#38017](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/38017) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Use `clang-14` and LLVM infrastructure version 14 for builds. This closes [#34681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34681). [#34754](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34754) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### <a id="225"></a> ClickHouse release 22.5, 2022-05-19

#### Upgrade Notes

* Now, background merges, mutations and `OPTIMIZE` will not increment `SelectedRows` and `SelectedBytes` metrics. They (still) will increment `MergedRows` and `MergedUncompressedBytes` as it was before. This only affects the metric values, and makes them better. This change does not introduce any incompatibility, but you may wonder about the changes of metrics, so we put in this category. [#37040](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37040) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Updated the BoringSSL module to the official FIPS compliant version. This makes ClickHouse FIPS compliant. [#35914](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35914) ([Meena-Renganathan](https://github.com/Meena-Renganathan)). The ciphers `aes-192-cfb128` and `aes-256-cfb128` were removed, because they are not included in the FIPS certified version of BoringSSL.
* `max_memory_usage` setting is removed from the default user profile in `users.xml`. This enables flexible memory limits for queries instead of the old rigid limit of 10 GB.
* Disable `log_query_threads` setting by default. It controls the logging of statistics about every thread participating in query execution. After supporting asynchronous reads, the total number of distinct thread ids became too large, and logging into the `query_thread_log` has become too heavy. [#37077](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37077) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove function `groupArraySorted` which has a bug. [#36822](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36822) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### New Feature

* Enable memory overcommit by default. [#35921](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35921) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Add support of GROUPING SETS in GROUP BY clause. This implementation supports a parallel processing of grouping sets. [#33631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33631) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Added `system.certificates` table. [#37142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37142) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Adds `h3Line`, `h3Distance` and `h3HexRing` functions. [#37030](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37030) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* New single binary based diagnostics tool (clickhouse-diagnostics). [#36705](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36705) ([Dale McDiarmid](https://github.com/gingerwizard)).
* Add output format `Prometheus` [#36051](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36051). [#36206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36206) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Add `MySQLDump` input format. It reads all data from INSERT queries belonging to one table in dump. If there are more than one table, by default it reads data from the first one. [#36667](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36667) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Show the `total_rows` and `total_bytes` fields in `system.tables` for temporary tables. [#36401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36401). [#36439](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36439) ([xiedeyantu](https://github.com/xiedeyantu)).
* Allow to override `parts_to_delay_insert` and `parts_to_throw_insert` with query-level settings. If they are defined, they will override table-level settings. [#36371](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36371) ([Memo](https://github.com/Joeywzr)).

#### Experimental Feature

* Implemented L1, L2, Linf, Cosine distance functions for arrays and L1, L2, Linf norm functions for arrays.
 [#37033](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37033) ([qieqieplus](https://github.com/qieqieplus)). Caveat: the functions will be renamed.
* Improve the `WATCH` query in WindowView: 1. Reduce the latency of providing query results by calling the `fire_condition` signal. 2. Makes the cancel query operation(ctrl-c) faster, by checking `isCancelled()` more frequently. [#37226](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37226) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider)).
* Introspection for remove filesystem cache. [#36802](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36802) ([Han Shukai](https://github.com/KinderRiven)).
* Added new hash function `wyHash64` for SQL. [#36467](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36467) ([olevino](https://github.com/olevino)).
* Improvement for replicated databases: Added `SYSTEM SYNC DATABASE REPLICA` query which allows to sync tables metadata inside Replicated database, because currently synchronisation is asynchronous. [#35944](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35944) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Improvement for remote filesystem cache: Better read from cache. [#37054](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37054) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)). Improve `SYSTEM DROP FILESYSTEM CACHE` query: `<path>` option and `FORCE` option. [#36639](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36639) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Improvement for semistructured data: Allow to cast columns of type `Object(...)` to `Object(Nullable(...))`. [#36564](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36564) ([awakeljw](https://github.com/awakeljw)).
* Improvement for parallel replicas: We create a local interpreter if we want to execute query on localhost replica. But for when executing query on multiple replicas we rely on the fact that a connection exists so replicas can talk to coordinator. It is now improved and localhost replica can talk to coordinator directly in the same process. [#36281](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36281) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

#### Performance Improvement

* Improve performance of `avg`, `sum` aggregate functions if used without GROUP BY expression. [#37257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37257) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of unary arithmetic functions (`bitCount`, `bitNot`, `abs`, `intExp2`, `intExp10`, `negate`, `roundAge`, `roundDuration`, `roundToExp2`, `sign`) using dynamic dispatch. [#37289](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37289) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of ORDER BY, MergeJoin, insertion into MergeTree using JIT compilation of sort columns comparator. [#34469](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34469) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Change structure of `system.asynchronous_metric_log`. It will take about 10 times less space. This closes [#36357](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36357). The field `event_time_microseconds` was removed, because it is useless. [#36360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36360) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Load marks for only necessary columns when reading wide parts. [#36879](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36879) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* Improves performance of file descriptor cache by narrowing mutex scopes. [#36682](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36682) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* Improve performance of reading from storage `File` and table functions `file` in case when path has globs and matched directory contains large number of files. [#36647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36647) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Apply parallel parsing for input format `HiveText`, which can speed up HiveText parsing by 2x when reading local file. [#36650](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36650) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* The default `HashJoin` is not thread safe for inserting right table's rows and run it in a single thread. When the right table is large, the join process is too slow with low cpu utilization. [#36415](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36415) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Allow to rewrite `select countDistinct(a) from t` to `select count(1) from (select a from t groupBy a)`. [#35993](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35993) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).

* Allowed to increase the number of threads for executing background operations (merges, mutations, moves and fetches) at runtime if they are specified at top level config. [#36425](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36425) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Now date time conversion functions that generates time before 1970-01-01 00:00:00 with partial hours/minutes timezones will be saturated to zero instead of overflow. This is the continuation of https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/29953 which addresses https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/29953#discussion_r800550280 . Mark as improvement because it's implementation defined behavior (and very rare case) and we are allowed to break it. [#36656](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36656) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Add a warning if someone running clickhouse-server with log level "test". The log level "test" was added recently and cannot be used in production due to inevitable, unavoidable, fatal and life-threatening performance degradation. [#36824](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36824) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Parse collations in CREATE TABLE, throw exception or ignore. closes [#35892](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35892). [#36271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36271) ([yuuch](https://github.com/yuuch)).
* Option `compatibility_ignore_auto_increment_in_create_table` allows ignoring `AUTO_INCREMENT` keyword in a column declaration to simplify migration from MySQL. [#37178](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37178) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).

* Fix bug which can lead to forgotten outdated parts in MergeTree table engines family in case of filesystem failures during parts removal. Before fix they will be removed only after first server restart. [#37014](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37014) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Implemented a new mode of handling row policies which can be enabled in the main configuration which enables users without permissive row policies to read rows. [#36997](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36997) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Play UI: Nullable numbers will be aligned to the right in table cells. This closes [#36982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36982). [#36988](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36988) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Play UI: If there is one row in result and more than a few columns, display the result vertically. Continuation of [#36811](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36811). [#36842](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36842) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Cleanup CSS in Play UI. The pixels are more evenly placed. Better usability for long content in table cells. [#36569](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36569) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Finalize write buffers in case of exception to avoid doing it in destructors. Hope it fixes: [#36907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36907). [#36979](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36979) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* After [#36425](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36425) settings like `background_fetches_pool_size` became obsolete and can appear in top level config, but clickhouse throws and exception like `Error updating configuration from '/etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml' config.: Code: 137. DB::Exception: A setting 'background_fetches_pool_size' appeared at top level in config /etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml.` This is fixed. [#36917](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36917) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Add extra diagnostic info (if applicable) when sending exception to other server. [#36872](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36872) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Allow to execute hash functions with arguments of type `Array(Tuple(..))`. [#36812](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36812) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

* The metrics about time spent reading from s3 now calculated correctly. Close [#35483](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35483). [#36572](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36572) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow file descriptors in table function file if it is run in clickhouse-local. [#36562](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36562) ([wuxiaobai24](https://github.com/wuxiaobai24)).
* Allow names of tuple elements that start from digits. [#36544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36544) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Now clickhouse-benchmark can read authentication info from environment variables. [#36497](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36497) ([Anton Kozlov](https://github.com/tonickkozlov)).
* `clickhouse-keeper` improvement: add support for force recovery which allows you to reconfigure cluster without quorum. [#36258](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36258) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Improve schema inference for JSON objects. [#36207](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36207) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Refactor code around schema inference with globs. Try next file from glob only if it makes sense (previously we tried next file in case of any error). Also it fixes [#36317](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36317). [#36205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36205) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add a separate `CLUSTER` grant (and `access_control_improvements.on_cluster_queries_require_cluster_grant` configuration directive, for backward compatibility, default to `false`). [#35767](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35767) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* If the required amount of memory is available before the selected query stopped, all waiting queries continue execution. Now we don't stop any query if memory is freed before the moment when the selected query knows about the cancellation. [#35637](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35637) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Nullables detection in protobuf. In proto3, default values are not sent on the wire. This makes it non-trivial to distinguish between null and default values for Nullable columns. A standard way to deal with this problem is to use Google wrappers to nest the target value within an inner message (see https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/wrappers.proto). In this case, a missing field is interpreted as null value, a field with missing value if interpreted as default value, and a field with regular value is interpreted as regular value. However, ClickHouse interprets Google wrappers as nested columns. We propose to introduce special behaviour to detect Google wrappers and interpret them like in the description above. For example, to serialize values for a Nullable column `test`, we would use `google.protobuf.StringValue test` in our .proto schema. Note that these types are so called "well-known types" in Protobuf, implemented in the library itself. [#35149](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35149) ([Jakub Kuklis](https://github.com/jkuklis)).
* Added support for specifying `content_type` in predefined and static HTTP handler config. [#34916](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34916) ([Roman Nikonov](https://github.com/nic11)).
* Warn properly if use clickhouse-client --file without preceeding --external. Close [#34747](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34747). [#34765](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34765) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improve MySQL database engine to compatible with binary(0) dataType. [#37232](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37232) ([zzsmdfj](https://github.com/zzsmdfj)).
* Improve JSON report of clickhouse-benchmark. [#36473](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36473) ([Tian Xinhui](https://github.com/xinhuitian)).
* Server might refuse to start if it cannot resolve hostname of external ClickHouse dictionary. It's fixed. Fixes [#36451](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36451). [#36463](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36463) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

Although the cause of this problem is not clear, there should be code logic of repeatedly loading disk in ClickHouse, so we need to make special judgment for this situation. [#36737](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36737) ([Han Shukai](https://github.com/KinderRiven)).
* Fix vertical merges in wide parts. Previously an exception `There is no column` can be thrown during merge. [#36707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36707) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fix server reload on port change (do not wait for current connections from query context). [#36700](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36700) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Experimental feature: In the previous [PR](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36376), I found that testing (stateless tests, flaky check (address, actions)) is timeout. Moreover, testing locally can also trigger unstable system deadlocks. This problem still exists when using the latest source code of master. [#36697](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36697) ([Han Shukai](https://github.com/KinderRiven)).

### <a id="224"></a> ClickHouse release 22.4, 2022-04-19

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* Do not allow SETTINGS after FORMAT for INSERT queries (there is compatibility setting `allow_settings_after_format_in_insert` to accept such queries, but it is turned OFF by default). [#35883](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35883) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Function `yandexConsistentHash` (consistent hashing algorithm by Konstantin "kostik" Oblakov) is renamed to `kostikConsistentHash`. The old name is left as an alias for compatibility. Although this change is backward compatible, we may remove the alias in subsequent releases, that's why it's recommended to update the usages of this function in your apps. [#35553](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35553) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### New Feature

* Added INTERPOLATE extension to the ORDER BY ... WITH FILL. Closes [#34903](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34903). [#35349](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35349) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Profiling on Processors level (under `log_processors_profiles` setting, ClickHouse will write time that processor spent during execution/waiting for data to `system.processors_profile_log` table). [#34355](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34355) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added functions makeDate(year, month, day), makeDate32(year, month, day). [#35628](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35628) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)). Implementation of makeDateTime() and makeDateTIme64(). [#35934](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35934) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Support new type of quota `WRITTEN BYTES` to limit amount of written bytes during insert queries. [#35736](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35736) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Added function `flattenTuple`. It receives nested named `Tuple` as an argument and returns a flatten `Tuple` which elements are the paths from the original `Tuple`. E.g.: `Tuple(a Int, Tuple(b Int, c Int)) -> Tuple(a Int, b Int, c Int)`. `flattenTuple` can be used to select all paths from type `Object` as separate columns. [#35690](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35690) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Added functions `arrayFirstOrNull`, `arrayLastOrNull`. Closes [#35238](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35238). [#35414](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35414) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Added functions `minSampleSizeContinous` and `minSampleSizeConversion`. Author [achimbab](https://github.com/achimbab). [#35360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35360) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* New functions minSampleSizeContinous and minSampleSizeConversion. [#34354](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34354) ([achimbab](https://github.com/achimbab)).
* Introduce format `ProtobufList` (all records as repeated messages in out Protobuf). Closes [#16436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16436). [#35152](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35152) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Add `h3PointDistM`, `h3PointDistKm`, `h3PointDistRads`, `h3GetRes0Indexes`, `h3GetPentagonIndexes` functions. [#34568](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34568) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add `toLastDayOfMonth` function which rounds up a date or date with time to the last day of the month. [#33501](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33501). [#34394](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34394) ([Habibullah Oladepo](https://github.com/holadepo)).
* Added load balancing setting for \[Zoo\]Keeper client. Closes [#29617](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/29617). [#30325](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/30325) ([小路](https://github.com/nicelulu)).
* Add a new kind of row policies named `simple`. Before this PR we had two kinds or row policies: `permissive` and `restrictive`. A `simple` row policy adds a new filter on a table without any side-effects like it was for permissive and restrictive policies. [#35345](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35345) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Added an ability to specify cluster secret in replicated database. [#35333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35333) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Added sanity checks on server startup (available memory and disk space, max thread count, etc). [#34566](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34566) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* INTERVAL improvement - can be used with `[MILLI|MICRO|NANO]SECOND`. Added `toStartOf[Milli|Micro|Nano]second()` functions. Added `[add|subtract][Milli|Micro|Nano]seconds()`. [#34353](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34353) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).

#### Experimental Feature

* Added support for transactions for simple `MergeTree` tables. This feature is highly experimental and not recommended for production. Part of [#22086](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22086). [#24258](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/24258) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Support schema inference for type `Object` in format `JSONEachRow`. Allow to convert columns of type `Map` to columns of type `Object`. [#35629](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35629) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Allow to write remote FS cache on all write operations. Add `system.remote_filesystem_cache` table. Add `drop remote filesystem cache` query. Add introspection for s3 metadata with `system.remote_data_paths` table. Closes [#34021](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34021). Add cache option for merges by adding mode `read_from_filesystem_cache_if_exists_otherwise_bypass_cache` (turned on by default for merges and can also be turned on by query setting with the same name). Rename cache related settings (`remote_fs_enable_cache -> enable_filesystem_cache`, etc). [#35475](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35475) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* An option to store parts metadata in RocksDB. Speed up parts loading process of MergeTree to accelerate starting up of clickhouse-server. With this improvement, clickhouse-server was able to decrease starting up time from 75 minutes to 20 seconds, with 700k mergetree parts. [#32928](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32928) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).

#### Performance Improvement

* A new query plan optimization. Evaluate functions after `ORDER BY` when possible. As an example, for a query `SELECT sipHash64(number) FROM numbers(1e8) ORDER BY number LIMIT 5`, function `sipHash64` would be evaluated after `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, which gives ~20x speed up. [#35623](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35623) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Sizes of hash tables used during aggregation now collected and used in later queries to avoid hash tables resizes. [#33439](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33439) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Improvement for hasAll function using SIMD instructions (SSE and AVX2). [#27653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/27653) ([youennL-cs](https://github.com/youennL-cs)). [#35723](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35723) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Multiple changes to improve ASOF JOIN performance (1.2 - 1.6x as fast). It also adds support to use big integers. [#34733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34733) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improve performance of ASOF JOIN if key is native integer. [#35525](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35525) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Parallelization of multipart upload into S3 storage. [#35343](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35343) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* URL storage engine now downloads multiple chunks in parallel if the endpoint supports HTTP Range. Two additional settings were added, `max_download_threads` and `max_download_buffer_size`, which control maximum number of threads a single query can use to download the file and the maximum number of bytes each thread can process. [#35150](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35150) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Use multiple threads to download objects from S3. Downloading is controllable using `max_download_threads` and `max_download_buffer_size` settings. [#35571](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35571) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Narrow mutex scope when interacting with HDFS. Related to [#35292](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35292). [#35646](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35646) ([shuchaome](https://github.com/shuchaome)).
* Require mutations for per-table TTL only when it had been changed. [#35953](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35953) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### Improvement

* Multiple improvements for schema inference. Use some tweaks and heuristics to determine numbers, strings, arrays, tuples and maps in CSV, TSV and TSVRaw data formats. Add setting `input_format_csv_use_best_effort_in_schema_inference` for CSV format that enables/disables using these heuristics, if it's disabled, we treat everything as string. Add similar setting `input_format_tsv_use_best_effort_in_schema_inference` for TSV/TSVRaw format. These settings are enabled by default. - Add Maps support for schema inference in Values format. - Fix possible segfault in schema inference in Values format. - Allow to skip columns with unsupported types in Arrow/ORC/Parquet formats. Add corresponding settings for it: `input_format_{parquet|orc|arrow}_skip_columns_with_unsupported_types_in_schema_inference`. These settings are disabled by default. - Allow to convert a column with type Null to a Nullable column with all NULL values in Arrow/Parquet formats. - Allow to specify column names in schema inference via setting `column_names_for_schema_inference` for formats that don't contain column names (like CSV, TSV, JSONCompactEachRow, etc) - Fix schema inference in ORC/Arrow/Parquet formats in terms of working with Nullable columns. Previously all inferred types were not Nullable and it blocked reading Nullable columns from data, now it's fixed and all inferred types are always Nullable (because we cannot understand that column is Nullable or not by reading the schema). - Fix schema inference in Template format with CSV escaping rules. [#35582](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35582) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add parallel parsing and schema inference for format `JSONAsObject`. [#35592](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35592) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

* Added support for schema inference for `hdfsCluster`. [#35602](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35602) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Add new setting `input_format_json_read_bools_as_numbers` that allows to infer and parse bools as numbers in JSON input formats. It's enabled by default. Suggested by @alexey-milovidov. [#35735](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35735) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Improve columns ordering in schema inference for formats TSKV and JSONEachRow, closes [#35640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35640). Don't stop schema inference when reading empty row in schema inference for formats TSKV and JSONEachRow. [#35724](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35724) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add settings `input_format_orc_case_insensitive_column_matching`, `input_format_arrow_case_insensitive_column_matching`, and `input_format_parquet_case_insensitive_column_matching` which allows ClickHouse to use case insensitive matching of columns while reading data from ORC, Arrow or Parquet files. [#35459](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35459) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Added `is_secure` column to `system.query_log` which denotes if the client is using a secure connection over TCP or HTTP. [#35705](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35705) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Now `kafka_num_consumers` can be bigger than amount of physical cores in case of low resource machine (less than 16 cores). [#35926](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35926) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Add some basic metrics to monitor engine=Kafka tables. [#35916](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35916) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Now it's not allowed to `ALTER TABLE ... RESET SETTING` for non-existing settings for MergeTree engines family. Fixes [#35816](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35816). [#35884](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35884) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Now some `ALTER MODIFY COLUMN` queries for `Arrays` and `Nullable` types can be done at metadata level without mutations. For example, alter from `Array(Enum8('Option1'=1))` to `Array(Enum8('Option1'=1, 'Option2'=2))`. [#35882](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35882) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

* Improve projection analysis to optimize trivial queries such as `count()`. [#35788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35788) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Support schema inference for insert select with using `input` table function. Get schema from insertion table instead of inferring it from the data in case of insert select from table functions that support schema inference. Closes [#35639](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35639). [#35760](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35760) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Respect `remote_url_allow_hosts` for Hive tables. [#35743](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35743) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Implement `send_logs_level` for clickhouse-local. Closes [#35653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35653). [#35716](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35716) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

* It was possible to get stack overflow in distributed queries if one of the settings `async_socket_for_remote` and `use_hedged_requests` is enabled while parsing very deeply nested data type (at least in debug build). Closes [#35509](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35509). [#35524](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35524) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Proper support of setting `max_rows_to_read` in case of reading in order of sorting key and specified limit. Previously the exception `Limit for rows or bytes to read exceeded` could be thrown even if query actually requires to read less amount of rows. [#33230](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33230) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

### <a id="223"></a> ClickHouse release v22.3-lts, 2022-03-17

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* Make `arrayCompact` function behave as other higher-order functions: perform compaction not of lambda function results but on the original array. If you're using nontrivial lambda functions in arrayCompact you may restore old behaviour by wrapping `arrayCompact` arguments into `arrayMap`. Closes [#34010](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34010) [#18535](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/18535) [#14778](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14778). [#34795](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34795) ([Alexandre Snarskii](https://github.com/snar)).
* Change implementation specific behavior on overflow of function `toDatetime`. It will be saturated to the nearest min/max supported instant of datetime instead of wraparound. This change is highlighted as "backward incompatible" because someone may unintentionally rely on the old behavior. [#32898](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32898) ([HaiBo Li](https://github.com/marising)).
* Make function `cast(value, 'IPv4')`, `cast(value, 'IPv6')` behave same as `toIPv4`, `toIPv6` functions. Changed behavior of incorrect IP address passed into functions `toIPv4`,` toIPv6`,  now if invalid IP address passes into this functions exception will be raised, before this function return default value. Added functions `IPv4StringToNumOrDefault`, `IPv4StringToNumOrNull`, `IPv6StringToNumOrDefault`, `IPv6StringOrNull` `toIPv4OrDefault`, `toIPv4OrNull`, `toIPv6OrDefault`, `toIPv6OrNull`. Functions `IPv4StringToNumOrDefault `, `toIPv4OrDefault `, `toIPv6OrDefault ` should be used if previous logic relied on `IPv4StringToNum`, `toIPv4`, `toIPv6` returning default value for invalid address. Added setting `cast_ipv4_ipv6_default_on_conversion_error`, if this setting enabled, then IP address conversion functions will behave as before. Closes [#22825](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22825). Closes [#5799](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5799). Closes [#35156](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35156). [#35240](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35240) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).

#### New Feature

* Support for caching data locally for remote filesystems. It can be enabled for `s3` disks. Closes [#28961](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28961). [#33717](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33717) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)). In the meantime, we enabled the test suite on s3 filesystem and no more known issues exist, so it is started to be production ready.
* Add new table function `hive`. It can be used as follows `hive('<hive metastore url>', '<hive database>', '<hive table name>', '<columns definition>', '<partition columns>')` for example `SELECT * FROM hive('thrift://hivetest:9083', 'test', 'demo', 'id Nullable(String), score Nullable(Int32), day Nullable(String)', 'day')`. [#34946](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34946) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Support authentication of users connected via SSL by their X.509 certificate. [#31484](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31484) ([eungenue](https://github.com/eungenue)).
* Support schema inference for inserting into table functions `file`/`hdfs`/`s3`/`url`. [#34732](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34732) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Now you can read `system.zookeeper` table without restrictions on path or using `like` expression. This reads can generate quite heavy load for zookeeper so to enable this ability you have to enable setting `allow_unrestricted_reads_from_keeper`. [#34609](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34609) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Display CPU and memory metrics in clickhouse-local. Close [#34545](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34545). [#34605](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34605) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Implement `startsWith` and `endsWith` function for arrays, closes [#33982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33982). [#34368](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34368) ([usurai](https://github.com/usurai)).
* Add three functions for Map data type: 1. `mapReplace(map1, map2)` - replaces values for keys in map1 with the values of the corresponding keys in map2; adds keys from map2 that don't exist in map1. 2. `mapFilter` 3. `mapMap`. mapFilter and mapMap are higher order functions, accepting two arguments, the first argument is a lambda function with k, v pair as arguments, the second argument is a column of type Map. [#33698](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33698) ([hexiaoting](https://github.com/hexiaoting)).
* Allow getting default user and password for clickhouse-client from the `CLICKHOUSE_USER` and `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` environment variables. Close [#34538](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34538). [#34947](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34947) ([DR](https://github.com/freedomDR)).

#### Experimental Feature

* New data type `Object(<schema_format>)`, which supports storing of semi-structured data (for now JSON only). Data is written to such types as string. Then all paths are extracted according to format of semi-structured data and written as separate columns in most optimal types, that can store all their values. Those columns can be queried by names that match paths in source data. E.g `data.key1.key2` or with cast operator `data.key1.key2::Int64`.
* Add `database_replicated_allow_only_replicated_engine` setting. When enabled, it only allowed to only create `Replicated` tables or tables with stateless engines in `Replicated` databases. [#35214](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35214) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)). Note that `Replicated` database is still an experimental feature.

#### Performance Improvement

* Improve performance of insertion into `MergeTree` tables by optimizing sorting. Up to 2x improvement is observed on realistic benchmarks. [#34750](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34750) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Columns pruning when reading Parquet, ORC and Arrow files from URL and S3. Closes [#34163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34163). [#34849](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34849) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Columns pruning when reading Parquet, ORC and Arrow files from Hive. [#34954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34954) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* A bunch of performance optimizations from a performance superhero. Improve performance of processing queries with large `IN` section. Improve performance of `direct` dictionary if its source is `ClickHouse`. Improve performance of `detectCharset `, `detectLanguageUnknown ` functions. [#34888](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34888) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Improve performance of `any` aggregate function by using more batching. [#34760](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34760) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Multiple improvements for performance of `clickhouse-keeper`: less locking [#35010](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35010) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)), lower memory usage by streaming reading and writing of snapshot instead of full copy. [#34584](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34584) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)), optimizing compaction of log store in the RAFT implementation. [#34534](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34534) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)), versioning of the internal data structure [#34486](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34486) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).

#### Improvement

* Allow asynchronous inserts to table functions. Fixes [#34864](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34864). [#34866](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34866) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Implicit type casting of the key argument for functions `dictGetHierarchy`, `dictIsIn`, `dictGetChildren`, `dictGetDescendants`. Closes [#34970](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34970). [#35027](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35027) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* `EXPLAIN AST` query can output AST in form of a graph in Graphviz format: `EXPLAIN AST graph = 1 SELECT * FROM system.parts`. [#35173](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35173) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* When large files were written with `s3` table function or table engine, the content type on the files was mistakenly set to `application/xml` due to a bug in the AWS SDK. This closes [#33964](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33964). [#34433](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34433) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Change restrictive row policies a bit to make them an easier alternative to permissive policies in easy cases. If for a particular table only restrictive policies exist (without permissive policies) users will be able to see some rows. Also `SHOW CREATE ROW POLICY` will always show `AS permissive` or `AS restrictive` in row policy's definition. [#34596](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34596) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Improve schema inference with globs in File/S3/HDFS/URL engines. Try to use the next path for schema inference in case of error. [#34465](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34465) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Play UI now correctly detects the preferred light/dark theme from the OS. [#35068](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35068) ([peledni](https://github.com/peledni)).
* Added `date_time_input_format = 'best_effort_us'`. Closes [#34799](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34799). [#34982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34982) ([WenYao](https://github.com/Cai-Yao)).
* A new settings called `allow_plaintext_password` and `allow_no_password` are added in server configuration which turn on/off authentication types that can be potentially insecure in some environments. They are allowed by default. [#34738](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34738) ([Heena Bansal](https://github.com/HeenaBansal2009)).
* Support for `DateTime64` data type in `Arrow` format, closes [#8280](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8280) and closes [#28574](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28574). [#34561](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34561) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Reload `remote_url_allow_hosts` (filtering of outgoing connections) on config update. [#35294](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35294) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Support `--testmode` parameter for `clickhouse-local`. This parameter enables interpretation of test hints that we use in functional tests. [#35264](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35264) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add `distributed_depth` to query log. It is like a more detailed variant of `is_initial_query` [#35207](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35207) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Respect `remote_url_allow_hosts` for `MySQL` and `PostgreSQL` table functions. [#35191](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35191) ([Heena Bansal](https://github.com/HeenaBansal2009)).
* Added `disk_name` field to `system.part_log`. [#35178](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35178) ([Artyom Yurkov](https://github.com/Varinara)).

* Currently, if the user changes the settings of the system tables there will be tons of logs and ClickHouse will rename the tables every minute. This fixes [#34929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34929). [#34949](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34949) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

* Extract schema only once on table creation and prevent reading from local files/external sources to extract schema on each server startup. [#34684](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34684) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow specifying argument names for executable UDFs. This is necessary for formats where argument name is part of serialization, like `Native`, `JSONEachRow`. Closes [#34604](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34604). [#34653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34653) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement

* Package repository is migrated to JFrog Artifactory (**Mikhail f. Shiryaev**).
* Randomize some settings in functional tests, so more possible combinations of settings will be tested. This is yet another fuzzing method to ensure better test coverage. This closes [#32268](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32268). [#34092](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34092) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Limit DWARF version for debug info by 4 max, because our internal stack symbolizer cannot parse DWARF version 5. This makes sense if you compile ClickHouse with clang-15. [#34777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34777) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove `clickhouse-test` debian package as unneeded complication. CI use tests from repository and standalone testing via deb package is no longer supported. [#34606](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34606) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehaviour in official stable or prestable release)

* A fix for HDFS integration: When the inner buffer size is too small, NEED_MORE_INPUT in `HadoopSnappyDecoder` will run multi times (>=3) for one compressed block.

### <a id="222"></a> ClickHouse release v22.2, 2022-02-17

#### Upgrade Notes

* Applying data skipping indexes for queries with FINAL may produce incorrect result. In this release we disabled data skipping indexes by default for queries with FINAL (a new setting `use_skip_indexes_if_final` is introduced and disabled by default). [#34243](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34243) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### New Feature

* Projections are production ready. Set `allow_experimental_projection_optimization` by default and deprecate this setting. [#34456](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34456) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* An option to create a new files on insert for `File`/`S3`/`HDFS` engines. Allow to overwrite a file in `HDFS`. Throw an exception in attempt to overwrite a file in `S3` by default. Throw an exception in attempt to append data to file in formats that have a suffix (and thus don't support appends, like `Parquet`, `ORC`). Closes [#31640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31640) Closes [#31622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31622) Closes [#23862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23862) Closes [#15022](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15022) Closes [#16674](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16674). [#33302](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33302) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add a setting that allows a user to provide own deduplication semantic in `MergeTree`/`ReplicatedMergeTree` If provided, it's used instead of data digest to generate block ID. So, for example, by providing a unique value for the setting in each INSERT statement, the user can avoid the same inserted data being deduplicated. This closes: [#7461](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7461). [#32304](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32304) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Add support of `DEFAULT` keyword for INSERT statements. Closes [#6331](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6331). [#33141](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33141) ([Andrii Buriachevskyi](https://github.com/1over)).
* `EPHEMERAL` column specifier is added to `CREATE TABLE` query. Closes [#9436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9436). [#34424](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34424) ([yakov-olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Support `IF EXISTS` clause for `TTL expr TO [DISK|VOLUME] [IF EXISTS] 'xxx'` feature. Parts will be moved to disk or volume only if it exists on replica, so `MOVE TTL` rules will be able to behave differently on replicas according to the existing storage policies. Resolves [#34455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34455). [#34504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34504) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

* Add schema inference for `values` table function. Closes [#33811](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33811). [#34017](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34017) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Dynamic reload of server TLS certificates on config reload. Closes [#15764](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15764). [#15765](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15765) ([johnskopis](https://github.com/johnskopis)). [#31257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31257) ([Filatenkov Artur](https://github.com/FArthur-cmd)).
* Now ReplicatedMergeTree can recover data when some of its disks are broken. [#13544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13544) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Fault-tolerant connections in clickhouse-client: `clickhouse-client ... --host host1 --host host2 --port port2 --host host3 --port port --host host4`. [#34490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34490) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)). [#33824](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33824) ([Filippov Denis](https://github.com/DF5HSE)).
* Add `DEGREES` and `RADIANS` functions for MySQL compatibility. [#33769](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33769) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add `h3ToCenterChild` function. [#33313](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33313) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)). Add new h3 miscellaneous functions: `edgeLengthKm`,`exactEdgeLengthKm`,`exactEdgeLengthM`,`exactEdgeLengthRads`,`numHexagons`. [#33621](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33621) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add function `bitSlice` to extract bit subsequences from String/FixedString. [#33360](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33360) ([RogerYK](https://github.com/RogerYK)).
* Implemented `meanZTest` aggregate function. [#33354](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33354) ([achimbab](https://github.com/achimbab)).
* Add confidence intervals to T-tests aggregate functions. [#33260](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33260) ([achimbab](https://github.com/achimbab)).
* Add function `addressToLineWithInlines`. Close [#26211](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/26211). [#33467](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33467) ([SuperDJY](https://github.com/cmsxbc)).
* Added `#!` and `# ` as a recognised start of a single line comment. Closes [#34138](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34138). [#34230](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34230) ([Aaron Katz](https://github.com/aaronstephenkatz)).

#### Experimental Feature

* Functions for text classification: language and charset detection. See [#23271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23271). [#33314](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33314) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Add memory overcommit to `MemoryTracker`. Added `guaranteed` settings for memory limits which represent soft memory limits. In case when hard memory limit is reached, `MemoryTracker` tries to cancel the most overcommited query. New setting `memory_usage_overcommit_max_wait_microseconds` specifies how long queries may wait another query to stop. Closes [#28375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/28375). [#31182](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31182) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).

### <a id="221"></a> ClickHouse release v22.1, 2022-01-18

#### Upgrade Notes

* The functions `left` and `right` were previously implemented in parser and now full-featured. Distributed queries with `left` or `right` functions without aliases may throw exception if cluster contains different versions of clickhouse-server. If you are upgrading your cluster and encounter this error, you should finish upgrading your cluster to ensure all nodes have the same version. Also you can add aliases (`AS something`) to the columns in your queries to avoid this issue. [#33407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33407) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Resource usage by scalar subqueries is fully accounted since this version. With this change, rows read in scalar subqueries are now reported in the query_log. If the scalar subquery is cached (repeated or called for several rows) the rows read are only counted once. This change allows KILLing queries and reporting progress while they are executing scalar subqueries. [#32271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32271) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

#### New Feature

* Implement data schema inference for input formats. Allow to skip structure (or write just `auto`) in table functions `file`, `url`, `s3`, `hdfs` and in parameters of `clickhouse-local` . Allow to skip structure in create query for table engines `File`, `HDFS`, `S3`, `URL`, `Merge`, `Buffer`, `Distributed` and `ReplicatedMergeTree` (if we add new replicas). [#32455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32455) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Detect format by file extension in `file`/`hdfs`/`s3`/`url` table functions and `HDFS`/`S3`/`URL` table engines and also for `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` and `INSERT FROM INFILE` [#33565](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33565) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)). Close [#30918](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/30918). [#33443](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33443) ([OnePiece](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* A tool for collecting diagnostics data if you need support. [#33175](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33175) ([Alexander Burmak](https://github.com/Alex-Burmak)).
* Automatic cluster discovery via Zoo/Keeper. It allows to add replicas to the cluster without changing configuration on every server. [#31442](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31442) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Implement hive table engine to access apache hive from clickhouse. This implements: [#29245](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/29245). [#31104](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31104) ([taiyang-li](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Add aggregate functions `cramersV`, `cramersVBiasCorrected`, `theilsU` and `contingency`. These functions calculate dependency (measure of association) between categorical values. All these functions are using cross-tab (histogram on pairs) for implementation. You can imagine it like a correlation coefficient but for any discrete values (not necessary numbers). [#33366](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33366) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)). Initial implementation by [Vanyok-All-is-OK](https://github.com/Vanyok-All-is-OK) and [antikvist](https://github.com/antikvist).
* Added table function `hdfsCluster` which allows processing files from HDFS in parallel from many nodes in a specified cluster, similarly to `s3Cluster`. [#32400](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32400) ([Zhichang Yu](https://github.com/yuzhichang)).
* Adding support for disks backed by Azure Blob Storage, in a similar way it has been done for disks backed by AWS S3. [#31505](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31505) ([Jakub Kuklis](https://github.com/jkuklis)).

* Added `left`, `right`, `leftUTF8`, `rightUTF8` functions. Fix error in implementation of `substringUTF8` function with negative offset (offset from the end of string). [#33407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33407) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add new functions for `H3` coordinate system: `h3HexAreaKm2`, `h3CellAreaM2`, `h3CellAreaRads2`. [#33479](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33479) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add `MONTHNAME` function. [#33436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33436) ([usurai](https://github.com/usurai)).
* Added function `arrayLast`. Closes [#33390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33390). [#33415](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33415) Added function `arrayLastIndex`. [#33465](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33465) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Add function `decodeURLFormComponent` slightly different to `decodeURLComponent`. Close [#10298](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10298). [#33451](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33451) ([SuperDJY](https://github.com/cmsxbc)).
* Allow to split `GraphiteMergeTree` rollup rules for plain/tagged metrics (optional rule_type field). [#33494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33494) ([Michail Safronov](https://github.com/msaf1980)).


#### Performance Improvement

* Support moving conditions to `PREWHERE` (setting `optimize_move_to_prewhere`) for tables of `Merge` engine if its all underlying tables supports `PREWHERE`. [#33300](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33300) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* More efficient handling of globs for URL storage. Now you can easily query million URLs in parallel with retries. Closes [#32866](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32866). [#32907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32907) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Avoid exponential backtracking in parser. This closes [#20158](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/20158). [#33481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33481) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Abuse of `untuple` function was leading to exponential complexity of query analysis (found by fuzzer). This closes [#33297](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33297). [#33445](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33445) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Reduce allocated memory for dictionaries with string attributes. [#33466](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33466) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Slight performance improvement of `reinterpret` function. [#32587](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32587) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Non significant change. In extremely rare cases when data part is lost on every replica, after merging of some data parts, the subsequent queries may skip less amount of partitions during partition pruning. This hardly affects anything. [#32220](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32220) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Improve `clickhouse-keeper` writing performance by optimization the size calculation logic. [#32366](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32366) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Optimize single part projection materialization. This closes [#31669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31669). [#31885](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/31885) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

* Optimize selecting of MergeTree parts that can be moved between volumes. [#33225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33225) ([OnePiece](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* Fix `sparse_hashed` dict performance with sequential keys (wrong hash function). [#32536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32536) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).


#### Experimental Feature

* Parallel reading from multiple replicas within a shard during distributed query without using sample key. To enable this, set `allow_experimental_parallel_reading_from_replicas = 1` and `max_parallel_replicas` to any number. This closes [#26748](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/26748). [#29279](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/29279) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Implemented sparse serialization. It can reduce usage of disk space and improve performance of some queries for columns, which contain a lot of default (zero) values. It can be enabled by setting `ratio_for_sparse_serialization`. Sparse serialization will be chosen dynamically for column, if it has ratio of number of default values to number of all values above that threshold. Serialization (default or sparse) will be fixed for every column in part, but may varies between parts. [#22535](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22535) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

* Support TABLE OVERRIDE clause for MaterializedPostgreSQL. RFC: [#31480](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/31480). [#32749](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32749) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Change ZooKeeper path for zero-copy marks for shared data. Note that "zero-copy replication" is non-production feature (in early stages of development) that you shouldn't use anyway. But in case if you have used it, let you keep in mind this change. [#32061](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32061) ([ianton-ru](https://github.com/ianton-ru)).
* Events clause support for WINDOW VIEW watch query. [#32607](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32607) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider)).
* Fix ACL with explicit digit hash in `clickhouse-keeper`: now the behavior consistent with ZooKeeper and generated digest is always accepted. [#33249](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33249) ([小路](https://github.com/nicelulu)). [#33246](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33246).
* Fix unexpected projection removal when detaching parts. [#32067](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32067) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).


#### Improvement

* Improve `Bool` type serialization and deserialization, check the range of values. [#32984](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32984) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* If an invalid setting is defined using the `SET` query or using the query parameters in the HTTP request, error message will contain suggestions that are similar to the invalid setting string (if any exists). [#32946](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32946) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Support hints for mistyped setting names for clickhouse-client and clickhouse-local. Closes [#32237](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32237). [#32841](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32841) ([凌涛](https://github.com/lingtaolf)).

* Allow negative intervals in function `intervalLengthSum`. Their length will be added as well. This closes [#33323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33323). [#33335](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33335) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `LineAsString` can be used as output format. This closes [#30919](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/30919). [#33331](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33331) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Support `<secure/>` in cluster configuration, as an alternative form of `<secure>1</secure>`. Close [#33270](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33270). [#33330](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33330) ([SuperDJY](https://github.com/cmsxbc)).
* Pressing Ctrl+C twice will terminate `clickhouse-benchmark` immediately without waiting for in-flight queries. This closes [#32586](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/32586). [#33303](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33303) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support Unix timestamp with milliseconds in `parseDateTimeBestEffort` function. [#33276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33276) ([Ben](https://github.com/benbiti)).
* Allow to cancel query while reading data from external table in the formats: `Arrow` / `Parquet` / `ORC` - it failed to be cancelled it case of big files and setting input_format_allow_seeks as false.
