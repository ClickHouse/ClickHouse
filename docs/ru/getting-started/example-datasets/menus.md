# New York Public Library "What's on the Menu?" Dataset

The dataset is created by the New York Public Library. It contains historical data on the menus of hotels, restaurants and cafes with the dishes along with their prices.

Source: http://menus.nypl.org/data
The data is in public domain.

The data is from library's archive and it may be incomplete and difficult for statistical analysis. Nevertheless it is also very yummy.
The size is just 1.3 million records about dishes in the menus (a very small data volume for ClickHouse, but it's still a good example).
