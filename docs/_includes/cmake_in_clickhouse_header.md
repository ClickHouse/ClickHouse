# CMake in ClickHouse

## TL; DR How to make ClickHouse compile and link faster?

Minimal ClickHouse build example:

```bash
cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$(which clang-11) \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$(which clang++-11) \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_ALL=OFF \
    -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_SERVER=ON \
    -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_CLIENT=ON \
    -DENABLE_LIBRARIES=OFF \
    -DUSE_UNWIND=ON \
    -DENABLE_UTILS=OFF \
    -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF
```

## CMake files types

1. ClickHouse's source CMake files (located in the root directory and in `/src`).
2. Arch-dependent CMake files (located in `/cmake/*os_name*`).
3. Libraries finders (search for contrib libraries, located in `/cmake/find`).
3. Contrib build CMake files (used instead of libraries' own CMake files, located in `/cmake/modules`)

## List of CMake flags

* This list is auto-generated by [this Python script](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/blob/master/docs/tools/cmake_in_clickhouse_generator.py).
* The flag name is a link to its position in the code.
* If an option's default value is itself an option, it's also a link to its position in this list.
