# 2023 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v23.3.6.7-lts (7e3f0a271b7) FIXME as compared to v23.3.5.9-lts (f5fbc2fd2b3)

#### Improvement
* Backported in [#51240](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/51240): Improve the progress bar for file/s3/hdfs/url table functions by using chunk size from source data and using incremental total size counting in each thread. Fix the progress bar for *Cluster functions. This closes [#47250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47250). [#51088](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51088) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Backported in [#51529](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/51529): Split huge `RUN` in Dockerfile into smaller conditional. Install the necessary tools on demand in the same `RUN` layer, and remove them after that. Upgrade the OS only once at the beginning. Use a modern way to check the signed repository. Downgrade the base repo to ubuntu:20.04 to address the issues on older docker versions. Upgrade golang version to address golang vulnerabilities. [#51504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/51504) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).

* Fix type of LDAP server params hash in cache entry [#50865](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50865) ([Julian Maicher](https://github.com/jmaicher)).
