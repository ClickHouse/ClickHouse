# 2025 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v25.5.4.38-stable (304d67604cf) FIXME as compared to v25.5.3.75-stable (3321577b6dd)

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Backported in [#82187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82187): Fix logical error during materialize projection when column type was changed to Nullable. [#80741](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80741) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#82332](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82332): Fix `IN` execution with `transform_null_in=1` with null in the left argument and non-nullable subquery result. [#81584](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81584) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#82177](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82177): Don't validate experimental/suspicious types in default/materialize expression execution during reading from existing table. [#81618](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81618) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#82032](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82032): Fix the issue where required columns are not read during scalar correlated subquery processing. Fixes [#81716](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/81716). [#81805](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81805) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Backported in [#82324](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82324): In previous versions, the server returned excessive content for requests to `/js`. This closes [#61890](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61890). [#81895](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81895) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Backported in [#82236](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82236): Previously, `MongoDB` table engine definitions could include a path component in the `host:port` argument which was silently ignored. The mongodb integration refuses to load such tables. With this fix *we allow loading such tables and ignore path component* if `MongoDB` engine has five arguments, using the database name from arguments. *Note:* The fix is not applied for newly created tables or queries with `mongo` table function, as well as for dictionary sources and named collections.
