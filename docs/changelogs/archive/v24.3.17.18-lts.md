# 2025 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v24.3.17.18-lts (b163637e2f7) FIXME as compared to v24.3.16.16-lts (1303dad1849)

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Backported in [#75640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75640): Fix docker init script fail log message for more clean understanding. [#71734](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71734) ([Андрей](https://github.com/andreineustroev)).
* Backported in [#76227](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76227): Fix crash due to uncaught exception in PSQL replication. [#75062](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75062) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Backported in [#76101](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76101): Fix nullsafe JOIN handling for LowCardinality nullable data type. Previously JOIN ON with nullsafe comparison, such as `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`, `<=>` , `a IS NULL AND b IS NULL OR a == b` didn't work correctly with LowCardinality columns. [#75143](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75143) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Backported in [#75830](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75830): Fixed null pointer dereference in `DistinctSortedStreamTransform`. [#75734](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75734) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Backported in [#76224](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76224): Make all clickhouse-server related actions a function, and execute them only when launching the default binary in `entrypoint.sh`. A long-postponed improvement was suggested in [#50724](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50724). Added switch `--users` to `clickhouse-extract-from-config` to get values from the `users.xml`. [#75643](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75643) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).

#### NOT FOR CHANGELOG / INSIGNIFICANT

* Backported in [#75504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75504): Fix the flaky test in `test_replicated_merge_tree_s3_zero_copy/test.py::test_drop_table` by reducing the loop count and backoff period to avoid exceeding the client timeout. [#73102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73102) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* Fix tests. [#75675](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75675) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
