It prevents from incorrect result of schema inference with these settings changed. [#65980](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65980) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

In more detail, containers often run their process in the root cgroup which has an empty name. In that case, ClickHouse ignored the CPU limits set by cgroups v2. [#66237](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66237) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
