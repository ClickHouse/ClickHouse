# 2025 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v24.8.13.16-lts (c8a1e828dcf) FIXME as compared to v24.8.12.28-lts (832432bd021)

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Backported in [#74804](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74804): Fix security issue to prevent SQL injection in postgresql and sqlite table functions. [#74144](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74144) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
* Backported in [#74386](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74386): Fix logical error in s3queue during setting file as failed. [#74216](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74216) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Backported in [#74867](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74867): Keeper fix: fix reading log entries from disk. [#74785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74785) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Backported in [#75285](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75285): Improvement to set even more restrictive defaults. The current defaults are already secure - the user has to specify an option to publish ports explicitly. But when the `default` user doesnâ€™t have a password set by `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` and/or a username changed by `CLICKHOUSE_USER` environment variables, it should be available only from the local system as an additional level of protection. [#75259](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75259) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).

#### NOT FOR CHANGELOG / INSIGNIFICANT

* Backported in [#74923](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74923): Fix calculation of metrics `BackupsThreadsActive` and `RestoreThreadsActive`. Those metrics were not updated before this PR. [#74456](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74456) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Backported in [#74681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74681): A follow-up for [#74399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74399), send the event as early as possible. [#74666](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74666) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
