#### Improvement
* Backported in [#86504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/86504): Add ability to enable JSON logging only for specific channel, for this set `logger.formatting.channel` to one of `syslog`/`console`/`errorlog`/`log`.

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Backported in [#86112](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/86112): Using `distributed_depth` as an indicator of *Cluster function was incorrect and may lead to data duplication; use `client_info.collaborate_with_initiator` instead.
