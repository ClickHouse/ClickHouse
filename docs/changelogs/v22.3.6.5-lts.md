### ClickHouse release v22.3.6.5-lts FIXME as compared to v22.3.5.5-lts

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehaviour in official stable or prestable release)

* Backported in [#36525](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36525): Queries with aliases inside special operators returned parsing error (was broken in 22.1). Example: `SELECT substring('test' AS t, 1, 1)`. [#36167](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36167) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Backported in [#36795](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36795): Fix vertical merges in wide parts. Previously an exception `There is no column` can be thrown during merge. [#36707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36707) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
