# 2022 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v22.9.7.34-stable (613fe09ca2e) FIXME as compared to v22.9.6.20-stable (ef6343f9579)

#### Bug Fix
* Backported in [#43099](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43099): Updated normaliser to clone the alias ast. resolves [#42452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42452) Implementation: * Updated QueryNormalizer to clone alias ast, when its replaced. Previously just assigning the same leads to exception in LogicalExpressinsOptimizer as it would be the same parent being inserted again. * This bug is not seen with new analyser (allow_experimental_analyzer), so no changes for it. I added a test for the same. [#42827](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/42827) ([SmitaRKulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
