### ClickHouse release v20.9.5.5-stable FIXME as compared to v20.9.4.76-stable

#### Bug Fix
* Backported in [#16493](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16493): Fix bug with MySQL database. When MySQL server used as database engine is down some queries raise Exception, because they try to get tables from disabled server, while it's unnecessary. For example, query `SELECT ... FROM system.parts` should work only with MergeTree tables and don't touch MySQL database at all.

* Backported in [#16817](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16817): Fixed the inconsistent behaviour when a part of return data could be dropped because the set for its filtration wasn't created.
