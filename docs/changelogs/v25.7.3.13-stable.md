# 2025 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v25.7.3.13-stable (47579ad7fd6) FIXME as compared to v25.7.2.54-stable (f3e0b608695)

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Backported in [#85306](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/85306): Fix ALTER MODIFY ORDER BY not validating TTL columns in sorting keys. TTL columns are now properly rejected when used in ORDER BY clauses during ALTER operations, preventing potential table corruption. [#84536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84536) ([xiaohuanlin](https://github.com/xiaohuanlin)).
* Backported in [#85381](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/85381): Fixed cleanup of patch parts in `ReplicatedMergeTree`. Previously, the result of a lightweight update may temporarily not be visible on the replica until the merged or mutated part that materializes the patch parts is downloaded from another replica. [#85121](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85121) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Backported in [#85246](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/85246): Fixing illegal_type_of_argument in mv when types are different. [#85135](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85135) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Backported in [#85236](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/85236): Fix `Not-ready Set` for `IN (subquery)` inside `additional_table_filters expression` setting. [#85210](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85210) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Backported in [#85264](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/85264): Get rid of unnecessary `getStatus()` calls during SYSTEM DROP REPLICA queries. Fixes the case when a table is dropped in the background, and the `Shutdown for storage is called` exception is thrown. [#85220](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85220) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).

#### NOT FOR CHANGELOG / INSIGNIFICANT

* Backported in [#85284](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/85284): Avoid some copies in Keeper. [#85131](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85131) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
