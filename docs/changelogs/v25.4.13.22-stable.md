# 2025 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v25.4.13.22-stable (189cbf21a52) FIXME as compared to v25.4.12.9-stable (65820a0cf71)

#### Improvement
* Backported in [#84033](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/84033): Use information from cgroup (if applicable, i.e. `memory_worker_use_cgroup` and cgroups are available) to adjust memory tracker (`memory_worker_correct_memory_tracker`). [#83981](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83981) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Backported in [#83140](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83140): Do not use unrelated parts of a shared dictionary in the `lowCardinalityKeys` function. [#83118](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83118) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Backported in [#84105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/84105): Mask Avro schema registry authentication details to be not visible to user or in logs. [#83713](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83713) ([JÃ¡nos Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Backported in [#83913](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83913): Fix the issue where, if a MergeTree table is created with `add_minmax_index_for_numeric_columns=1` or `add_minmax_index_for_string_columns=1`, the index is later materialized during an ALTER operation, and it prevents the Replicated database from initializing correctly on a new replica. [#83751](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83751) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Backported in [#83872](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83872): Introduce backward compatibility setting to allow new analyzer to reference outer alias in WITH clause in the case of name clashes. Fixes [#82700](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82700). [#83797](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83797) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Backported in [#84090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/84090): When restoring from backup, the definer user may not be backed up, which will cause the whole backup to be broken. To fix this, we postpone the permissions check on the target table's creation during restore and only check it during runtime. [#83818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83818) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Backported in [#84268](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/84268): Fixed wrong results when the query condition cache is used in conjunction with recursive CTEs (issue [#81506](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/81506)). [#84026](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84026) ([zhongyuankai](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).

#### NOT FOR CHANGELOG / INSIGNIFICANT

* Backported in [#84046](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/84046): `sccache` supports explicit server start. We should start it before the `ninja` build stage. [#83600](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83600) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Backported in [#83862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83862): Allow concurrent tables creation when `max_database_replicated_create_table_thread_pool_size` setting is 0 (automatic pool size). [#83834](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83834) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
