* Backported in [#80963](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/80963): Disable filter-push-down for the predicate with a non-deterministic function in case the query plan step changes the number of rows. Fixes [#40273](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40273). [#80329](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80329) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

* Backported in [#80755](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/80755): Fix possible crash in case of dictionary registration failed (when `CREATE DICTIONARY` failed with `CANNOT_SCHEDULE_TASK` it is possible to leave dangling pointer in the dictionary registry, which later lead to crash). [#80714](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80714) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Backported in [#81143](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/81143): Fix wrong result type of comparison functions with Tuple(Dynamic) and String that led to logical error. [#80728](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80728) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Backported in [#80872](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/80872): Fix crash in Kafka due to get_member_id() was creating std::string from NULL (it was likely an issue only in case of connection to broker had been failed).

* Backported in [#80912](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/80912): Properly wait consumers before shutting down Kafka engine (active consumers after shutdown can trigger various debug assertions and also may read data from brokers in background after table has been dropped/detached).
