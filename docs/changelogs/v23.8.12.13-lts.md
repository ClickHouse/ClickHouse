# 2024 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v23.8.12.13-lts (bdbd0d87e5d) FIXME as compared to v23.8.11.28-lts (31879d2ab4c)

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)

* Backported in [#61439](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61439): The query cache now denies access to entries when the user is re-created or assumes another role. This improves prevents attacks where 1. an user with the same name as a dropped user may access the old user's cache entries or 2. a user with a different role may access cache entries of a role with a different row policy. [#58611](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58611) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Backported in [#61572](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61572): Fix string search with constant start position which previously could lead to memory corruption. [#61547](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61547) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Backported in [#61854](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61854): Fix crash in `multiSearchAllPositionsCaseInsensitiveUTF8` when specifying incorrect UTF-8 sequence. Example: [#61714](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61714#issuecomment-2012768202). [#61749](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/61749) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
