# 2025 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v24.3.18.7-lts (807f69cd6a8) FIXME as compared to v24.3.17.18-lts (b163637e2f7)

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Backported in [#76214](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76214): `clickhouse-library-bridge` allows opening arbitrary libraries from the filesystem, which makes it safe to run only inside an isolated environment. To prevent a vulnerability when it is run near the clickhouse-server, we will limit the paths of libraries to a location, provided in the configuration. This vulnerability was found with the [ClickHouse Bug Bounty Program](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38986) by **Arseniy Dugin**. [#75954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75954) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
