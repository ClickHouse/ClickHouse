### ClickHouse release v22.7.3.5-stable (e140b8b5f3a) FIXME as compared to v22.7.2.15-stable (f843089624e)

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Backported in [#39884](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/39884): Former packages used to install systemd.service file to `/etc`.

Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
