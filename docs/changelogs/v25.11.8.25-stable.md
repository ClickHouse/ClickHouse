# 2026 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v25.11.8.25-stable (4081364020e) FIXME as compared to v25.11.7.41-stable (d635abf3eae)

#### Improvement
* Backported in [#94933](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94933): Force purging of jemalloc arenas in case the ratio of dirty pages size to `max_server_memory_usage` exceeds `memory_worker_purge_dirty_pages_threshold_ratio`. [#93500](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/93500) ([Eduard Karacharov](https://github.com/korowa)).
* Backported in [#94729](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94729): Add support for SQL-defined named collections in BACKUP/RESTORE for S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Closes [#94604](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94604). [#94605](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/94605) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
* Backported in [#95166](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/95166): Run purging of jemalloc dirty pages in a different thread from main thread of MemoryWorker. If purging is slow, it could delay updates of RSS usage which could lead to out of memory kills of the process. Introduce new config `memory_worker_purge_total_memory_threshold_ratio` to start purging dirty pages based on ratio of total memory usage. [#94902](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/94902) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Backported in [#94765](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94765): Fix join results when the right-side join key is a sparse column. This closes [#92920](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/92920). I can only reproduce the bug with `set compatibility='23.3'`. Not sure if it should be backported. [#93038](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/93038) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Backported in [#94886](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94886): Fix attaching Replicated DBs when the interserver host changed after restarting. [#93779](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/93779) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* Backported in [#94592](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94592): Fix type conversion to super type during the join operation of the storage `Join` with `USING` clause. Fixes [#91672](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/91672). Fixes [#78572](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/78572). [#94000](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/94000) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Backported in [#94357](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94357): Fix bad check for typed paths in JSON. Checj was introduced in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/92842 and can lead to error during existing tables startup. [#94070](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/94070) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#95202](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/95202): Fix function to subcolumns optimization not applied to subcolumns. [#94323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/94323) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#94718](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94718): Fix a crash during ANY LEFT JOIN optimization when `isNotNull` is evaluated on a missing column. [#94600](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/94600) ([Molly](https://github.com/ggmolly)).
* Backported in [#94813](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94813): Fix permission issues in BACKUP/RESTORE operations. [#94617](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/94617) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
* Backported in [#94844](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94844): Fixes https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-core-incidents/issues/1250. Likely due to a mix-up, `data_type` (which may be `DataTypeNullable*`) is `static_cast`-ed to `DataTypeDateTime64*`. Instead, we should cast `check_type` (the nested type variable). [#94627](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/94627) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Backported in [#94796](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94796): Fix possibly incorrect RIGHT join result when using complex ON conditions.

* Backported in [#95150](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/95150): The `getURLHostRFC` function was missing bounds checks before dereferencing pointers. When an empty string was passed to `domainRFC`, it would read uninitialized memory, triggering MSan errors. [#94851](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/94851) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Backported in [#94994](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/94994): Fix readonlyness of encrypted disks. [#94852](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/94852) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Backported in [#95034](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/95034): Fix logical error in fractional `LIMIT/OFFSET` when using the old analyzer with Distributed tables.
