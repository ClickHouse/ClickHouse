# 2025 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v25.11.5.8-stable (06e6dea3bb5) FIXME as compared to v25.11.4.19-stable (2c64eff7334)

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Backported in [#92901](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/92901): Fix possible conflict in column and subcolumn with the same name leading in using wrong serialization and query failures. Closes [#90219](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/90219). Closes [#85161](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/85161). [#92453](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/92453) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#92988](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/92988): Avoid crash due to reading from a disconnected `Connection`. [#92807](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/92807) ([Raufs Dunamalijevs](https://github.com/rienath)).
* Backported in [#92879](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/92879): Fix logical error ` Failed to set file processing within 100 retries` in storgae `S3Queue` in `Ordered` mode. It is now replaced with a warning. This error could happen before 25.10 version if keeper session expired, however it will still be a warning in 25.10+ versions, as it is still theoretically possible to get this error in case of high processing concurrency in `Ordered` mode.

* Backported in [#92943](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/92943): Fixed usage of primary index in lightweight updates that have an `IN` clause with subqueries in the predicate of the `WHERE` clause. [#92838](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/92838) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Backported in [#92962](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/92962): Fix possible error `FILE_DOESNT_EXIST` after mutation of a sparse column with `ratio_of_defaults_for_sparse_serialization=0.0`. Closes [#92633](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/92633). [#92860](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/92860) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#92934](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/92934): Fix parquet schema inference in the old parquet reader (not used by default) when a JSON column comes after a Tupe column. Fix the old parquet reader (not used by default) failing on empty tuples. [#92867](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/92867) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
