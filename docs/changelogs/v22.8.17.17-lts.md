### ClickHouse release v22.8.17.17-lts (df7f2ef0b41) FIXME as compared to v22.8.16.32-lts (7c4be737bd0)

#### Improvement
* Backported in [#48157](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48157): Fixed `UNKNOWN_TABLE` exception when attaching to a materialized view that has dependent tables that are not available. This might be useful when trying to restore state from a backup. [#47975](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47975) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Backported in [#48957](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/48957): After the recent update, the `dockerd` requires `--tlsverify=false` together with the http port explicitly. [#48924](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48924) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)

* Remove a feature [#48195](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48195) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix possible segfault in cache [#48469](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/48469) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
