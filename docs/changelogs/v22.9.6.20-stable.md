# 2022 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v22.9.6.20-stable (ef6343f9579) FIXME as compared to v22.9.5.25-stable (68ba857aa82)

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Backported in [#43486](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43486): Fixed backward incompatibility in (de)serialization of states of `min`, `max`, `any*`, `argMin`, `argMax` aggregate functions with `String` argument. The incompatibility was introduced in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/41431 and affects 22.9, 22.10 and 22.11 branches (fixed since 22.9.6, 22.10.4 and 22.11.2 correspondingly). Some minor releases of 22.3, 22.7 and 22.8 branches are also affected: 22.3.13...22.3.14 (fixed since 22.3.15), 22.8.6...22.8.9 (fixed since 22.8.10), 22.7.6 and newer (will not be fixed in 22.7, we recommend to upgrade from 22.7.* to 22.8.10 or newer). This release note does not concern users that have never used affected versions. Incompatible versions append extra `'\0'` to strings when reading states of the aggregate functions mentioned above. For example, if an older version saved state of `anyState('foobar')` to `state_column` then incompatible version will print `'foobar\0'` on `anyMerge(state_column)`. Also incompatible versions write states of the aggregate functions without trailing `'\0'`. Newer versions (that have the fix) can correctly read data written by all versions including incompatible versions, except one corner case. If an incompatible version saved a state with a string that actually ends with null character, then newer version will trim trailing `'\0'` when reading state of affected aggregate function. For example, if an incompatible version saved state of `anyState('abrac\0dabra\0')` to `state_column` then incompatible versions will print `'abrac\0dabra'` on `anyMerge(state_column)`. The issue also affects distributed queries when an incompatible version works in a cluster together with older or newer versions.
