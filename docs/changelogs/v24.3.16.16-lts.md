# 2025 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v24.3.16.16-lts (1303dad1849) FIXME as compared to v24.3.15.72-lts (5148740fc78)

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Backported in [#74802](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74802): Fix security issue to prevent SQL injection in postgresql and sqlite table functions. [#74144](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74144) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
* Backported in [#74866](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74866): Keeper fix: fix reading log entries from disk. [#74785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74785) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Backported in [#75283](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75283): Improvement to set even more restrictive defaults. The current defaults are already secure - the user has to specify an option to publish ports explicitly. But when the `default` user doesnâ€™t have a password set by `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` and/or a username changed by `CLICKHOUSE_USER` environment variables, it should be available only from the local system as an additional level of protection. [#75259](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75259) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).

#### NOT FOR CHANGELOG / INSIGNIFICANT

* Backported in [#74921](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74921): Fix calculation of metrics `BackupsThreadsActive` and `RestoreThreadsActive`.

* Backported in [#74692](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74692): A follow-up for [#74399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74399), send the event as early as possible. [#74666](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74666) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Backported in [#75326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75326): Add option to skip user setup in entrypoint.sh. [#75316](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75316) ([Nikita Fomichev](https://github.com/fm4v)).
