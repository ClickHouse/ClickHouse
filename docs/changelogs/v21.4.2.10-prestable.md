# 2022 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v21.4.2.10-prestable FIXME as compared to v21.3.1.6185-prestable

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Column `keys` in table `system.dictionaries` was replaced to columns `key.names` and `key.types`. Columns `key.names`, `key.types`, `attribute.names`, `attribute.types` from `system.dictionaries` table does not require dictionary to be loaded. [#21884](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21884) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Fix `cutToFirstSignificantSubdomainCustom()`/`firstSignificantSubdomainCustom()` returning wrong result for 3+ level domains present in custom top-level domain list. For input domains matching these custom top-level domains, the third-level domain was considered to be the first significant one. This is now fixed. This change may introduce incompatibility if the function is used in e.g. the sharding key. [#21946](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21946) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* The `toStartOfIntervalFunction` will align hour intervals to the midnight (in previous versions they were aligned to the start of unix epoch). For example, `toStartOfInterval(x, INTERVAL 11 HOUR)` will split every day into three intervals: 00:00:00..10:59:59, 11:00:00..21:59:59 and 22:00:00..23:59:59. This behaviour is more suited for practical needs. This closes [#9510](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9510). [#22060](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22060) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### New Feature
* Extended range of `DateTime64` to properly support dates from year 1925 to 2283. Improved support of `DateTime` around zero date (`1970-01-01`). ... [#9404](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9404) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk)).
* - Added support of Kerberos authentication for preconfigured users and HTTP requests (GSS-SPNEGO). [#14995](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14995) ([Denis Glazachev](https://github.com/traceon)).
* Zero-copy replication for ReplicatedMergeTree over S3 storage. [#16240](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16240) ([ianton-ru](https://github.com/ianton-ru)).
* Support `dictHas` function for `RangeHashedDictionary`. Fixes [#6680](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6680). [#19816](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/19816) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Supports implicit key type conversion for JOIN. Closes [#18567](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/18567). [#19885](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/19885) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Allow customizing timeouts for http connections used for replication independently from other http timeouts. [#20088](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/20088) ([nvartolomei](https://github.com/nvartolomei)).
* Added async update in `ComplexKeyCache`, `SSDCache`, `SSDComplexKeyCache` dictionaries. Added support for Nullable type in `Cache`, `ComplexKeyCache`, `SSDCache`, `SSDComplexKeyCache` dictionaries. Added support for multiple attributes fetch with `dictGet`, `dictGetOrDefault` functions. Fixes [#21517](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21517). [#20595](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/20595) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Added `Grant,` `Revoke` and `System` values of `query_kind` column for corresponding queries in `system.query_log` ... [#21102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21102) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk)).
* Added new SQL command ALTER TABLE 'table_name' UNFREEZE [PARTITION 'part_expr'] WITH NAME 'backup_name'. [#21142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21142) ([Pavel Kovalenko](https://github.com/Jokser)).
* Added ExecutablePool dictionary source. Close [#14528](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14528). [#21321](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21321) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* - Add function `isIPAddressInRange` to test if an IPv4 or IPv6 address is contained in a given CIDR network prefix. [#21329](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21329) ([PHO](https://github.com/depressed-pho)).
* Add `_partition_id` virtual column for `MergeTree*` engines. Allow to prune partitions by `_partition_id`. Add `partitionID()` function to calculate partition id string. [#21401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21401) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Add new column `slowdowns_count` to `system.clusters`. When using hedged requests, it shows how many times we switched to another replica because this replica was responding slowly. Also show actual value of `errors_count` in `system.clusters`. [#21480](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21480) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add option `--backslash` for clickhouse-format, which can add a backslash at the end of each line of the formatted query. [#21494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21494) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Add new optional clause GRANTEES for CREATE/ALTER USER commands:. [#21641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21641) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add `ctime` option to `zookeeper-dump-tree`. It allows to dump node creation time. [#21842](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21842) ([Ilya](https://github.com/HumanUser)).
* Functions 'dictGet', 'dictHas' use current database name if it is not specified for dictionaries created with DDL. Closes [#21632](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21632). [#21859](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21859) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Support `Nullable` type for `PolygonDictionary` attribute. [#21890](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21890) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Added table function `dictionary`. It works the same way as `Dictionary` engine. Closes [#21560](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21560). [#21910](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21910) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Add function `timezoneOf` that returns the timezone name of `DateTime` or `DateTime64` data types. This does not close [#9959](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9959). Fix inconsistencies in function names: add aliases `timezone` and `timeZone` as well as `toTimezone` and `toTimeZone` and `timezoneOf` and `timeZoneOf`. [#22001](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22001) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add `prefer_column_name_to_alias` setting to use original column names instead of aliases. it is needed to be more compatible with common databases' aliasing rules. This is for [#9715](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9715) and [#9887](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9887). [#22044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22044) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Support parallel parsing for `CSVWithNames` and `TSVWithNames` formats. This closes [#21085](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21085). [#21149](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21149) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Improved performance by replacing `memcpy` to another implementation. This closes [#18583](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/18583). [#21520](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21520) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Supported parallel formatting in clickhouse-local and everywhere else. [#21630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21630) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Optimize performance of queries like `SELECT ... FINAL ... WHERE`. Now in queries with `FINAL` it's allowed to move to `PREWHERE` columns, which are in sorting key. ... [#21830](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21830) ([foolchi](https://github.com/foolchi)).
* Faster `GROUP BY` with small `max_rows_to_group_by` and `group_by_overflow_mode='any'`. [#21856](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21856) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Avoid unnecessary data copy when using codec `NONE`. Please note that codec `NONE` is mostly useless - it's recommended to always use compression (`LZ4` is by default). Despite the common belief, disabling compression may not improve performance (the opposite effect is possible). The `NONE` codec is useful in some cases: - when data is uncompressable; - for synthetic benchmarks. [#22145](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22145) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add cache for files read with `min_bytes_to_use_mmap_io` setting. It makes significant (2x and more) performance improvement when the value of the setting is small by avoiding frequent mmap/munmap calls and the consequent page faults. Note that mmap IO has major drawbacks that makes it less reliable in production (e.g. hung or SIGBUS on faulty disks; less controllable memory usage). Nevertheless it is good in benchmarks. [#22206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22206) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Enable read with mmap IO for file ranges from 64 MiB (the settings `min_bytes_to_use_mmap_io`). It may lead to moderate performance improvement. [#22326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22326) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Improvement
* Introduce a new merge tree setting `min_bytes_to_rebalance_partition_over_jbod` which allows assigning new parts to different disks of a JBOD volume in a balanced way. [#16481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16481) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Improve performance of aggregation in order of sorting key (with enabled setting `optimize_aggregation_in_order`). [#19401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/19401) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* MaterializeMySQL: add minmax skipping index for _version column. [#20382](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/20382) ([Stig Bakken](https://github.com/stigsb)).
* Do not create empty parts on INSERT when `optimize_on_insert` setting enabled. Fixes [#20304](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/20304). [#20387](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/20387) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* - Support more cases to rewrite `CROSS JOIN` to `INNER JOIN`. [#20392](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/20392) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* MaterializeMySQL: Attempt to reconnect to MySQL if the connection is lost. [#20961](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/20961) ([Håvard Kvålen](https://github.com/havardk)).
* Improve support of integer keys in data type `Map`. [#21157](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21157) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Improve clickhouse-format to not throw exception when there are extra spaces or comment after the last query, and throw exception early with readable message when format `ASTInsertQuery` with data . [#21311](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21311) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Age and Precision in graphite rollup configs should increase from retention to retention. Now it's checked and the wrong config raises an exception. [#21496](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21496) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Add setting `optimize_skip_unused_shards_limit` to limit the number of sharding key values for `optimize_skip_unused_shards`. [#21512](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21512) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add `last_error_time`/`last_error_message`/`last_error_stacktrace`/`remote` columns for `system.errors`. [#21529](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21529) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* If PODArray was instantiated with element size that is neither a fraction or a multiple of 16, buffer overflow was possible. No bugs in current releases exist. [#21533](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21533) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* - Propagate query and session settings for distributed DDL queries. Set `distributed_ddl_entry_format_version` to 2 to enable this. - Added `distributed_ddl_output_mode` setting. Supported modes: `none`, `throw` (default), `null_status_on_timeout` and `never_throw`. - Miscellaneous fixes and improvements for `Replicated` database engine. [#21535](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21535) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

* Support replicas priority for postgres dictionary source. [#21710](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21710) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Closes [#21701](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21701). Support non-default table schema for postgres storage/table-function. [#21711](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21711) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Better formatting for `Array` and `Map` data types in Web UI. [#21798](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21798) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* DiskS3 (experimental feature under development). Fixed bug with the impossibility to move directory if the destination is not empty and cache disk is used. [#21837](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21837) ([Pavel Kovalenko](https://github.com/Jokser)).
* Add connection pool for PostgreSQL table/database engine and dictionary source. Should fix [#21444](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21444). [#21839](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21839) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add profile event HedgedRequestsChangeReplica, change read data timeout from sec to ms. [#21886](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21886) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support `RANGE OFFSET` frame for floating point types. Implement `lagInFrame`/`leadInFrame` window functions, which are analogous to `lag`/`lead`, but respect the window frame. They are identical when the frame is `between unbounded preceding and unbounded following`. This closes [#5485](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5485). [#21895](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21895) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm)).
* Show path to data directory of `EmbeddedRocksDB` tables in system tables. [#21903](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21903) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Supported `replication_alter_partitions_sync=1` setting for moving partitions from helping table to destination. Decreased default timeouts. Fixes [#21911](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21911). [#21912](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21912) ([jasong](https://github.com/songenjie)).
* If partition key of a `MergeTree` table does not include `Date` or `DateTime` columns but includes exactly one `DateTime64` column, expose its values in the `min_time` and `max_time` columns in `system.parts` and `system.parts_columns` tables. Add `min_time` and `max_time` columns to `system.parts_columns` table (these was inconsistency to the `system.parts` table). This closes [#18244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/18244). [#22011](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22011) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Added case insensitive aliases for `CONNECTION_ID()` and `VERSION()` functions. This fixes [#22028](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22028). [#22042](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22042) ([Eugene Klimov](https://github.com/Slach)).
* Update used version of simdjson to 0.9.1. This fixes [#21984](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/21984). [#22057](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22057) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Convert `system.errors.stack_trace` from `String` into `Array(UInt64)` (This should decrease overhead for the errors collecting). [#22058](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22058) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* If tuple of NULLs, e.g. `(NULL, NULL)` is on the left hand side of `IN` operator with tuples of non-NULLs on the right hand side, e.g. `SELECT (NULL, NULL) IN ((0, 0), (3, 1))` return 0 instead of throwing an exception about incompatible types. The expression may also appear due to optimization of something like `SELECT (NULL, NULL) = (8, 0) OR (NULL, NULL) = (3, 2) OR (NULL, NULL) = (0, 0) OR (NULL, NULL) = (3, 1)`. This closes [#22017](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22017). [#22063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22063) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added possibility to migrate existing S3 disk to the schema with backup-restore capabilities. [#22070](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22070) ([Pavel Kovalenko](https://github.com/Jokser)).
* Add case-insensitive history search/navigation and subword movement features to clickhouse-client. [#22105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22105) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Add `current_database` column to `system.processes` table. It contains the current database of the query. [#22365](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22365) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm)).
* Fix MSan report for function `range` with `UInt256` argument (support for large integers is experimental). This closes [#22157](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22157). [#22387](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22387) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix error `Directory tmp_fetch_XXX already exists` which could happen after failed fetch part. Delete temporary fetch directory if it already exists. Fixes [#14197](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14197). [#22411](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22411) ([nvartolomei](https://github.com/nvartolomei)).
* Better exception message in client in case of exception while server is writing blocks. In previous versions client may get misleading message like `Data compressed with different methods`. [#22427](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22427) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
