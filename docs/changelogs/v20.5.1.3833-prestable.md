### ClickHouse release v20.5.1.3833-prestable FIXME as compared to v20.4.1.3177-prestable

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Remove `experimental_use_processors` setting. It is enabled by default. [#10924](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10924) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* The setting `input_format_with_names_use_header` is enabled by default. It will affect parsing of input formats `-WithNames` and `-WithNamesAndTypes`. [#10937](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10937) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added a check for the case when user-level setting is specified in a wrong place. User-level settings should be specified in `users.xml` inside `<profile>` section for specific user profile (or in `<default>` for default settings). The server won't start with exception message in log. This fixes [#9051](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9051). If you want to skip the check, you can either move settings to the appropriate place or add `<skip_check_for_incorrect_settings>1</skip_check_for_incorrect_settings>` to config.xml. [#11449](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11449) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Return non-Nullable result from COUNT(DISTINCT), and `uniq` aggregate functions family. If all passed values are NULL, return zero instead. This improves SQL compatibility. [#11661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11661) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Added OpenCl support and bitonic sort algorithm, which can be used for sorting integer types of data in single column. Needs to be build with flag `-DENABLE_OPENCL=1`. For using bitonic sort algorithm instead of others you need to set `bitonic_sort` for Setting's option `special_sort` and make sure that OpenCL is available. [#10232](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10232) ([Margarita Konnova [MARK]](https://github.com/margaritiko)).

* Improve performance of `clickhouse-client` in interactive mode when Pretty formats are used. In previous versions, significant amount of time can be spent calculating visible width of UTF-8 string. This closes [#11323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11323). [#11323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11323) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Provide synonims for some data types. [#10856](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10856) ([Павел Потемкин](https://github.com/Potya)).
* Introduce `min_insert_block_size_rows_for_materialized_views ` , `min_insert_block_size_bytes_for_materialized_views` settings. This settings are similar to `min_insert_block_size_rows` and `min_insert_block_size_bytes`, but applied only for blocks inserted into `MATERIALIZED VIEW`. It helps to control blocks squashing while pushing to MVs and avoid excessive memory usage. [#10858](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10858) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

[#10903](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10903) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Apply `TTL` for old data, after `ALTER MODIFY TTL` query. This behaviour is controlled by setting `materialize_ttl_after_modify`, which is enabled by default. [#11042](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11042) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Now `dictGet*` functions accept table names. [#11050](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11050) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Show authentication type in table system.users and while executing SHOW CREATE USER query. [#11080](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11080) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Enable percpu_arena:percpu for jemalloc (This will reduce memory fragmentation due to thread pool). [#11084](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11084) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add port() function (to extract port from URL). [#11120](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11120) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Resolved [#7224](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7224): added `FailedQuery`, `FailedSelectQuery` and `FailedInsertQuery` metrics to `system.events` table. [#11151](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11151) ([Nikita Orlov](https://github.com/naorlov)).
* The query log is now enabled by default. [#11184](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11184) ([Ivan Blinkov](https://github.com/blinkov)).
* When parsing C-style backslash escapes in string literals, VALUES and various text formats (this is an extension to SQL standard that is endemic for ClickHouse and MySQL), keep backslash if unknown escape sequence is found (e.g. `\%` or `\w`) that will make usage of `LIKE` and `match` regular expressions more convenient (it's enough to write `name LIKE 'used\_cars'` instead of `name LIKE 'used\\_cars'`) and more compatible at the same time. This fixes [#10922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10922). [#11208](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11208) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Keep the value of `DistributedFilesToInsert` metric on exceptions. In previous versions, the value was set when we are going to send some files, but it is zero, if there was an exception and some files are still pending. Now it corresponds to the number of pending files in filesystem. [#11220](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11220) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support kafka_client_id parameter for Kafka tables. It also changes the default `client.id` used by ClickHouse when communicating with Kafka to be more verbose and usable. [#11252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11252) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Update librdkafka to version [1.4.2](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/releases/tag/v1.4.2). [#11256](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11256) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).

* Better exception message in case when there is shortage of memory mappings. This closes [#11027](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11027). [#11316](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11316) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add setting "output_format_pretty_max_value_width". If value is longer, it will be cut to avoid output of too large values in terminal.

* Remove trailing whitespaces from formatted queries in `clickhouse-client` or `clickhouse-format` in some cases. [#11325](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11325) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Better log messages in while reloading configuration. [#11341](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11341) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

Change the default value of `timeout_before_checking_execution_speed` to non-zero, because otherwise the settings `min_execution_speed` and `max_execution_speed` have no effect. This fixes [#11297](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11297). This fixes [#5732](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5732). This fixes [#6228](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6228). Usability improvement: avoid concatenation of exception message with progress bar in `clickhouse-client`.
