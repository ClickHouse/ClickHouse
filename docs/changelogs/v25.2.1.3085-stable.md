# 2025 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v25.2.1.3085-stable (09989205d6f) FIXME as compared to v25.2.1.1-new (602ecc3b8da)

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Completely enable async_load_databases by default (even for those installations that do not upgrade `config.xml`). [#74772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74772) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add `JSONCompactEachRowWithProgress` and `JSONCompactStringsEachRowWithProgress` formats. Continuation of [#69989](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69989). The `JSONCompactWithNames` and `JSONCompactWithNamesAndTypes` no longer output "totals" - apparently, it was a mistake in the implementation. [#75037](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75037) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Change format_alter_operations_with_parentheses default to true to disambiguate alter commands list (see https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59532). This breaks replication with clusters prior to 24.3. If you are upgrading a cluster using older releases turn off the setting in the server config or upgrade to 24.3 first. [#75302](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75302) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Validate settings in cache configuration. Non existing settings were ignored before, now they will throw an error and they should be removed. [#75452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75452) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Remove possibility to filter log messages using regular expressions. The implementation introduced a data race, so it has to be removed. [#75577](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75577) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).

#### New Feature
* Added a new setting `enable_adaptive_memory_spill_scheduler` that allows multiple grace JOINs in the same query to monitor their combined memory footprint and trigger spilling into an external storage adaptively to prevent MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED. [#72728](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72728) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Add a new string comparison function `stringCompare` to compare parts of two strings. Example: `SELECT stringCompare('Saxony', 'Anglo-Saxon', 0, 6, 5) AS result` means "compare 6 bytes of strings 'Saxon' and 'Anglo-Saxon' lexicographically, starting at offset 0 in the first string, offset 5 in the second string". [#74070](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74070) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Added an ability to apply non-finished (not materialized by background process) mutations during the execution of `SELECT` queries immediately after submitting. It can be enabled by setting `apply_mutations_on_fly`. [#74877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74877) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fixed some previously unexpected cases when `toStartOfInterval` datetime arguments are negative. Done by implementing a new function called toStartOfIntervalAllowNegative, which does pretty much the same but returns only Date32/DateTime64. [#74933](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74933) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* A new function initialQueryStartTime has been added. It returns the start time of the current query. The value is the same across all shards during a distributed query. [#75087](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75087) ([Roman Lomonosov](https://github.com/lomik)).
* Add new Database engine `DatabaseBackup` that allows to instantly attach table/database from backup. [#75725](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75725) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Add ability to ATTACH tables without database layer (avoids UUID hack). [#75788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75788) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Restore QPL codec which has been removed in v24.10 due to licensing issues. [#76021](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76021) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Reintroduce respect `ttl_only_drop_parts` on `materialize ttl`; only read necessary columns to recalculate TTL and drop parts by replacing them with an empty one. [#72751](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72751) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Fixed calculation of size in memory for `LowCardinality` columns. [#74688](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74688) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Improve performance of the whole JSON column reading in Wide parts from S3. It's done by adding prefetches for subcolumn prefixes deserialization, cache of deserialized prefixes and parallel deserialization of subcolumn prefixes. It improves reading of the JSON column from S3 4 times in query like `SELECT data FROM table` and about 10 times in query like `SELECT data FROM table LIMIT 10`. [#74827](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74827) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fixed double preallocation in `ConcurrentHashJoin` in case join sides are swapped by the optimizer. [#75149](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75149) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Fixed unnecessary contention in `parallel_hash` when `max_rows_in_join = max_bytes_in_join = 0`. [#75155](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75155) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Slight improvement in some join scenarios: precalculate number of output rows and reserve memory for them. [#75376](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75376) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* `plain_rewritable` metadata files are small and do not need a large default buffer. Use a write buffer sized appropriately to fit the given path, improving memory utilization for a large number of active parts. ### Documentation entry for user-facing changes. [#75758](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75758) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* It was discovered that concurrency control could lead to unfair CPU distribution between INSERTs and SELECTs. When all CPU slots are allocated unconditionally (w/o competition) to INSERTs with `max_threads` = 1 while SELECTs with high `max_threads` values suffer from poor performance due to using only a single thread. [#75941](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75941) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Backported in [#76849](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76849): Actively evict data from the cache on parts removal. Do not let the cache grow to the maximum size if the amount of data is less. [#76641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76641) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Improvement
* Add support for SSL authentication with named collections for MySQL. Closes [#59111](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59111). [#59452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59452) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Drop blocks as early as possible to reduce the memory requirements. [#65647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65647) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* `processors_profile_log` table now has default configuration with TTL of 30 days. [#66139](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66139) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Introduce latency buckets and use them to track first byte read/write and connect times for S3 requests. That way we can later use gathered data to calculate approximate percentiles and adapt timeouts. [#69783](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69783) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Queries passed to `Executable` storage are no longer limited to single threaded execution. [#70084](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70084) ([yawnt](https://github.com/yawnt)).
* Evaluate parquet bloom filters and min/max indexes together. Necessary to properly support: `x = 3 or x > 5` where data = [1, 2, 4, 5]. [#71383](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71383) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Allow to shard names in cluster configuration. [#72276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72276) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* For query like, where a<b and b<c and c<5, can generate new comparing conditions (a<5 and b<5) to have better filter ability. [#73164](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73164) ([Shichao Jin](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Support type Nullable(JSON). [#73556](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73556) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix type mapping for SQLite (integer types into `int64`, floating points into `float64`). [#73853](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73853) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Change prometheus remote write response success status from 200/OK to 204/NoContent. [#74170](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74170) ([Michael Dempsey](https://github.com/bluestealth)).
* Add ability to reload `max_remote_read_network_bandwidth_for_serve` and `max_remote_write_network_bandwidth_for_server` on fly without restart server. [#74206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74206) ([Kai Zhu](https://github.com/nauu)).
* Support subcolumns in default and materialized expressions. [#74403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74403) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Added `dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname` libhdfs3 config option support. [#74635](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74635) ([Mikhail Tiukavkin](https://github.com/freshertm)).
* Allow using blob paths to calculate checksums while making a backup. [#74729](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74729) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Fetch parts in parallel in ALTER TABLE FETCH PARTITION (thread pool size is controlled with `max_fetch_partition_thread_pool_size`). [#74978](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74978) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added a query ID column to `system.query_cache` (issue [#68205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68205)). [#74982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74982) ([NamHoaiNguyen](https://github.com/NamHoaiNguyen)).
* Fix formatting of exceptions using a custom format if they appear during query interpretation. In previous versions, exceptions were formatted using the default format rather than the format specified in the query. This closes [#55422](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/55422). [#74994](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74994) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* It is allowed to cancel `ALTER TABLE ... FREEZE ...` queries with `KILL QUERY` and timeout(`max_execution_time`). [#75016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75016) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* Add support for `groupUniqArrayArrayMap` as `SimpleAggregateFunction`. [#75034](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75034) ([Miel Donkers](https://github.com/mdonkers)).
* Support prepared statements in postgres wire protocol. [#75035](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75035) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Hide catalog credential settings in database engine `Iceberg`. Closes [#74559](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74559). [#75080](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75080) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* ... Added a few missing features into BuzzHouse: `ILIKE` and `REGEXP` operators, plus <=> and `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`. [#75168](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75168) ([Pedro Ferreira](https://github.com/PedroTadim)).
* The setting `min_chunk_bytes_for_parallel_parsing` cannot be zero anymore. This fixes: [#71110](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71110). [#75239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75239) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* `intExp2` / `intExp10`: Define undefined behaviour: return 0 for too small argument, `18446744073709551615` for too big argument, throw exception if `nan`. [#75312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75312) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support `s3.endpoint` natively from catalog config in `DatabaseIceberg`. Closes [#74558](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74558). [#75375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75375) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Don't fail silently if user executing `SYSTEM DROP REPLICA` doesn't have enough permissions. [#75377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75377) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add a ProfileEvent about the number of times any of system logs has failed to flush. [#75466](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75466) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add check and logging for decrypting and decompressing. [#75471](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75471) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Added support for the micro sign (U+00B5) in the `parseTimeDelta` function. Now both the micro sign (U+00B5) and the Greek letter mu (U+03BC) are recognized as valid representations for microseconds, aligning ClickHouse's behavior with Go’s implementation ([see time.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ad7b46ee4ac1cee5095d64b01e8cf7fcda8bee5e/src/time/time.go#L983C19-L983C20) and [time/format.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ad7b46ee4ac1cee5095d64b01e8cf7fcda8bee5e/src/time/format.go#L1608-L1609)). [#75472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75472) ([Vitaly Orlov](https://github.com/orloffv)).
* Replace server setting (`send_settings_to_client`) with client setting (`apply_settings_from_server`) that controls whether client-side code (e.g. parsing INSERT data and formatting query output) should use settings from server's `users.xml` and user profile. Otherwise only settings from client command line, session, and the query are used. Note that this only applies to native client (not e.g. HTTP), and doesn't apply to most of query processing (which happens on the server). [#75478](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75478) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Keeper improvement: disable digest calculation when committing to in-memory storage for better performance. It can be enabled with `keeper_server.digest_enabled_on_commit` config. Digest is still calculated when preprocessing requests. [#75490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75490) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Push down filter expression from JOIN ON when possible. [#75536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75536) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Better error messages at syntax errors. Previously, if the query was too large, and the token whose length exceeds the limit is a very large string literal, the message about the reason was lost in the middle of two examples of this very long token. Fix the issue when a query with UTF-8 was cut incorrectly in the error message. Fix excessive quoting of query fragments. This closes [#75473](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75473). [#75561](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75561) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add profile events in storage `S3(Azure)Queue`. [#75618](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75618) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Disable sending settings from server to client (`send_settings_to_client=false`) for compatibility (This feature will be re-implemented as client setting later for better usability). [#75648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75648) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Add a config `memory_worker_correct_memory_tracker` to enable correction of internal memory tracker with information from different source read in the background thread periodically. [#75714](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75714) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Use Analyzer in PrometheusRemoteReadProtocol. [#75729](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75729) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Add column `normalized_query_hash` into `system.processes`. Note: while it can be easily calculated on the fly with the `normalizedQueryHash` function, this is needed to prepare for subsequent changes. [#75756](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75756) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Querying `system.tables` will not throw even if there is a `Merge` table created over a database that no longer exists. Remove the `getTotalRows` method from `Hive` tables, because we don't allow it to do complex work. [#75772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75772) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Web UI now has interactive database navigation. [#75777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75777) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow to combine read-only and read-write disks in storage policy (as multiple volumes, or multiple disks). This allows to read data from the entire volume, while inserts will prefer the writable disk (i.e. Copy-on-Write storage policy). [#75862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75862) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Store start_time/end_time for Backups with microseconds. [#75929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75929) ([Aleksandr Musorin](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).
* Add `MemoryTrackingUncorrected` metric showing value of internal global memory tracker which is not corrected by RSS. [#75935](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75935) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Calculate columns and indices sizes lazily in MergeTree. [#75938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75938) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow to parse endpoints like `localhost:1234/handle` in `postgresql` or `mysql` table functions. This fixes a regression introduced in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/52503. [#75944](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75944) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Added a server setting `throw_on_unknown_workload` that allows to choose behavior on query with `workload` setting set to unknown value: either allow unlimited access (default) or throw a `RESOURCE_ACCESS_DENIED` error. It is useful to force all queries to use workload scheduling. [#75999](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75999) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Make the new, experimental Kafka table engine fully respect Keeper feature flags. [#76004](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76004) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Don't rewrite subcolumns to getSubcolumn in ARRAY JOIN if not necessary. [#76018](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76018) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Retry coordination errors when loading tables. [#76020](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76020) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Support flushing individual logs in SYSTEM FLUSH LOGS. [#76132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76132) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improved the `/binary` server's page. Using the Hilbert curve instead of the Morton curve. Display 512 MB worth of addresses in the square, which fills the square better (in previous versions, addresses fill only half of the square). Color addresses closer to the library name rather than the function name. Allow scrolling a bit more outside of the area. [#76192](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76192) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Retry ON CLUSTER queries in case of TOO_MANY_SIMULTANEOUS_QUERIES. [#76352](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76352) ([Patrick Galbraith](https://github.com/CaptTofu)).
* Add the `CPUOverload` asynchronous metric, which calculates the relative CPU deficit of the server. [#76404](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76404) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Changed the default value of `output_format_pretty_max_rows` from 10000 to 1000. I think it is better for usability. [#76407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76407) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Backported in [#76611](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76611): Use correct fallback when multipart copy to S3 fails during backup with Access Denied. Multi part copy can generate Access Denied error when backup is done between buckets that have different credentials. [#76515](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76515) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Backported in [#76735](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76735): Fix validation of s3 request settings. [#76658](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76658) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).

* Revert part's state from deleting back to outdated when remove operation has failed. [#74985](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74985) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* In previous versions, when there was a scalar subquery, we started writing the progress (accumulated from processing the subquery) during the initialization of the data format, which was before HTTP headers were written. This led to the loss of HTTP headers, such as X-ClickHouse-QueryId and X-ClickHouse-Format, as well as Content-Type. [#74991](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74991) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fixed usage of indexes (primary and secondary) for `Array`, `Map` and `Nullable(..)` columns with enabled setting `optimize_function_to_subcolumns`. Previously, indexes for these columns could have been ignored. [#75081](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75081) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Disable `flatten_nested` when creating materialized views with inner tables since it will not be possible to use such flattened columns. [#75085](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75085) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Fix for some of IPv6 addresses (such as ::ffff:1.1.1.1) in forwarded_for field is wrongly interpreted resulting in client disconnect with exception. [#75133](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75133) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Fix nullsafe JOIN handling for LowCardinality nullable data type. Previously JOIN ON with nullsafe comparison, such as `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`, `<=>` , `a IS NULL AND b IS NULL OR a == b` didn't work correctly with LowCardinality columns. [#75143](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75143) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Checks that we don't specify key_condition when counting total_number_of_rows for NumRowsCache. [#75164](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75164) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).

* Fixed rare crashes while reading from `MergeTree` table after multiple asynchronous `RENAME` queries (with `alter_sync = 0`) between columns with different types. [#75693](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75693) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fix `Block structure mismatch in QueryPipeline stream` error for some queries with `UNION ALL`. [#75715](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75715) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Rebuild projection on alter modify of its PK column. Previously it could lead to `CANNOT_READ_ALL_DATA` errors during selects after alter modify of the column used in projection PK. [#75720](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75720) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Propagate format settings to JSON as string formatting in Native format. [#75832](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75832) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Recorded the default enablement of parallel hash as join algorithm in v24.12 in the settings change history. This means that ClickHouse will continue to join using non-parallel hash if an older compatibility level than v24.12 is configured. [#75870](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75870) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Fixed a bug that tables with implicitly added min-max indices could not be copied into a new table (issue [#75677](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75677)). [#75877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75877) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* `clickhouse-library-bridge` allows opening arbitrary libraries from the filesystem, which makes it safe to run only inside an isolated environment. To prevent a vulnerability when it is run near the clickhouse-server, we will limit the paths of libraries to a location, provided in the configuration. This vulnerability was found with the [ClickHouse Bug Bounty Program](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38986) by **Arseniy Dugin**. [#75954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75954) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* We happened to use JSON serialization for some metadata, which was a mistake, because JSON does not support binary data inside string literals, including zero bytes. SQL queries can contain binary data and invalid UTF-8, so we have to support this in our metadata files as well. At the same time, ClickHouse's `JSONEachRow` and similar formats work around that by deviating from the JSON standard in favor of a perfect roundtrip for the binary data. See the motivation here: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73668#issuecomment-2560501790. The solution is to make `Poco::JSON` library consistent with the JSON format serialization in ClickHouse. This closes [#73668](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73668). [#75963](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75963) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix check for commit limits in storage `S3Queue`. [#76104](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76104) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fix attaching MergeTree tables with auto indexes (`add_minmax_index_for_numeric_columns`/`add_minmax_index_for_string_columns`). [#76139](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76139) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fixed issue of stack traces from parent threads of a job (`enable_job_stack_trace` setting) are not printed out. Fixed issue `enable_job_stack_trace` setting is not properly propagated to the threads resulting stack trace content not always respects this setting. [#76191](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76191) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Fix incorrect permission check where `ALTER RENAME` required `CREATE USER` grant. Closes [#74372](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74372). [#76241](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76241) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).

[#76308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76308) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix logical error in S3Queue "Expected current processor {} to be equal to {} for bucket {}". [#76358](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76358) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

[#76726](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76726) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Backported in [#76876](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76876): Fix reverse key analysis for explicitly defined primary keys. Similar to [#76654](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76654). [#76846](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76846) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Restore deleted nats integration tests and fix errors. - fixed some race conditions in nats engine - fixed data loss when streaming data to nats in case of connection loss - fixed freeze of receiving the last chunk of data when streaming from nats ended - nats_max_reconnect is deprecated and has no effect, reconnect is performed permanently with nats_reconnect_wait timeout. [#69772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69772) ([Dmitry Novikov](https://github.com/dmitry-sles-novikov)).
* Support build HDFS on both ARM and Intel mac. [#74244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74244) ([Yan Xin](https://github.com/yxheartipp)).
* Update to embedded LLVM 19. [#75148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75148) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* *Potentially breaking*: Improvement to set even more restrictive defaults. The current defaults are already secure - the user has to specify an option to publish ports explicitly. But when the `default` user doesn’t have a password set by `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` and/or a username changed by `CLICKHOUSE_USER` environment variables, it should be available only from the local system as an additional level of protection. [#75259](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75259) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Integration tests have 1 hour timeout for single batch of parallel tests running. When this timeout is reached `pytest` is killed without some logs. Internal pytest timeout is set to 55 minutes to print results from a session and not trigger external timeout signal. Closes [#75532](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75532). [#75533](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75533) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Make all clickhouse-server related actions a function, and execute them only when launching the default binary in `entrypoint.sh`. A long-postponed improvement was suggested in [#50724](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50724). Added switch `--users` to `clickhouse-extract-from-config` to get values from the `users.xml`. [#75643](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75643) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* For stress tests if server did not exit while we collected stacktraces via gdb additional wait time is added to make `Possible deadlock on shutdown (see gdb.log)` detection less noisy. It will only add delay for cases when test did not finish successfully. [#75668](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75668) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Enable ICU and GRPC when cross-compiling for Darwin. [#75922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75922) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Fixing splitting test's output because of `sleep` during the process group killing. [#76090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76090) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Do not collect the `docker-compose` logs at the end of running since the script is often killed. Instead, collect them in the background. [#76140](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76140) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Split tests for kafka storage into a few files. Fixes [#69452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69452). [#76208](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76208) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Remove about 20MB of dead code from the binary. [#76226](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76226) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The long time outdated `pytest-random` is replaced by `pytest-random-order`. Enable `random-order` for flaky tests. Fix `test_dns_cache_update`. [#76233](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76233) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Raise minimum required CMake version to 3.25 due to `block()` introduction. [#76316](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76316) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Bump `lz4` to `1.10.0`. [#76571](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76571) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Bump `curl` to `8.12.1`. [#76572](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76572) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
