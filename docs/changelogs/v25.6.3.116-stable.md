# 2025 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v25.6.3.116-stable (3c68d19c3b3) FIXME as compared to v25.6.2.5-stable (51a12888a03)

#### Performance Improvement
* Backported in [#83343](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83343): Try to speedup QueryTreeHash a bit. [#82617](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82617) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

#### Improvement
* Backported in [#83207](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83207): Allow ALTER UPDATE in JSON and Dynamic columns. [#82419](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82419) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#83015](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83015): Keeper improvement: move changelog files between disk in a background thread. Previously, moving changelog to a different disk would block Keeper globally until the move is finished. This lead to performance degradation if moving is a long operation (e.g. to S3 disk). [#82485](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82485) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Backported in [#83205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83205): `SYSTEM RESTART REPLICA` may fail due to ZooKeeper connection issues. To avoid forgetting about this table, we now retry until the table is created. [#82616](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82616) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Backported in [#83270](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83270): Fix the wrong default value for the `--reconnect` option in `clickhouse-benchmark`. It was changed by mistake in [#79465](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/79465). [#82677](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82677) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Backported in [#82928](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82928): Keeper improvement: support specific permissions for world:anyone ACL. [#82755](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82755) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Backported in [#83146](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83146): Add columns `commit_time`, `commit_id` to `system.s3queue_log`. [#83016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83016) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Backported in [#83184](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83184): Consolidate unknown settings warnings in clickhouse client and log them as a summary. [#83042](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83042) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Backported in [#83281](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83281): There was an incorrect dependency check for the INSERT with MVs that have malformed selects and the user might have received an obscure `std::exception` instead of a meaningful error with a clear explanation. This is now fixed. This fixes: [#82889](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82889). [#83190](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83190) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

* Backported in [#83148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83148): Fix `DatabaseReplicated::getClusterImpl`. If the first element (or elements) of `hosts` has `id == DROPPED_MARK` and there are no other elements for the same shard, the first element of `shards` will be an empty vector, leading to `std::out_of_range`. [#82093](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82093) ([Mi—Åhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).

* Backported in [#82946](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82946): Fix data-races in client (by not using global context) and `session_timezone` overrides (previously in case of `session_timezone` was set in i.e. `users.xml`/client options to non empty and in query context to empty, then, value from `users.xml` was used, while this is wrong, now query context will always have a priority over global context). [#82444](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82444) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

* Backported in [#82915](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82915): In AzureBlobStorage, for native copy we compare authentication methods, during which if we get an exception, updated the code to fallback to read and copy (i.e. non native copy). [#82693](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82693) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Backported in [#82802](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82802): Fix deserialization of `groupArraySample`/`groupArrayLast` in case of empty elements (deserialization could skip part of the binary if the input was empty, this can lead to corruption during data read and UNKNOWN_PACKET_FROM_SERVER in TCP protocol). This does not affect numbers and date time types. [#82763](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82763) ([Pedro Ferreira](https://github.com/PedroTadim)).
