# 2026 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v25.11.6.11-stable (90415175004) FIXME as compared to v25.11.5.8-stable (06e6dea3bb5)

#### Performance Improvement
* Backported in [#92312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/92312): Https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/pull/84477 added constraints regarding select queries which can be used in `insert select from s3cluster()` queries for parallel distributed execution. this change allows using where, which was possible before. [#84611](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84611) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).

#### Improvement
* Backported in [#93375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/93375): Fallback to read-write copy for Azure Blob Storage when native copy fails with BadRequest (e.g. invalid block list). Previously this was only done for Unauthorized error which was seen while copying blob to different storage accounts. But we also sometimes see "The specified block list is invalid" error. So now updated the condition to fallback to read & write for all native copy fails. [#92888](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/92888) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Backported in [#93336](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/93336): Support geometry type for `flipCoordinates`. [#93303](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/93303) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Backported in [#93123](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/93123): Reworks incorrect logic in access grant checks for wildcard grants. The previous attempt https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/90928 addressed a critical vulnerability but ended up being too restrictive, resulting in some wildcard `GRANT` statements failing due to unrelated revokes. [#92725](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/92725) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Backported in [#93222](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/93222): Fix creating type hint for path 'skip' in JSON. Closes [#92731](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/92731). [#92842](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/92842) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#93182](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/93182): Fix possible error FILE_DOESNT_EXIST after sparse column mutation when setting `ratio_of_defaults_for_sparse_serialization` was changed to `1.0` via alter. [#93016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/93016) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#93046](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/93046): Fix bug in data skipping logic when `not materialize(...)` or `not CAST(...)` is used in WHERE causing incorrect results. Closes [#88536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/88536). [#93017](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/93017) ([Nihal Z. Miaji](https://github.com/nihalzp)).
* Backported in [#93057](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/93057): Fix leaving connection in a broken state after preliminary cancellation distributed queries. [#93029](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/93029) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Backported in [#93311](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/93311): Remove unused columns when the projection is rebuilt during the merge. It reduces memory usage and creates fewer temporary parts. [#93233](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/93233) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

#### NOT FOR CHANGELOG / INSIGNIFICANT

* Backported in [#93151](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/93151): tests: fix test_distributed_insert_select_to_rmt_where flakiness (due to deduplication). [#93130](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/93130) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
