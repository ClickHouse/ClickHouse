# 2024 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v24.12.1.1614-stable (a6d2b2e35b2) FIXME as compared to v24.12.1.1-new (e4c9b022237)

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Functions `greatest` and `least` now ignore NULL input values, whereas they previously returned NULL if one of the arguments was NULL. For example, `SELECT greatest(1, 2, NULL)` now returns 2. This makes the behavior compatible with PostgreSQL. [#65519](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65519) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* The legacy MongoDB integration based on the Poco driver has been removed. Server setting `use_legacy_mongodb_integration` is obsolete and has no effect anymore. [#71997](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71997) ([Kirill Nikiforov](https://github.com/allmazz)).

#### New Feature
* Added a query that allows to attach MergeTree tables as ReplicatedMergeTree and vice versa. [#65401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65401) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* Implement SYSTEM LOAD PRIMARY KEY command to load primary indexes for all parts of a specified table or for all tables if no table is specified. This will be useful for benchmarks and to prevent extra latency during query execution. [#66252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66252) ([ZAWA_ll](https://github.com/Zawa-ll)).
* Added statement `SYSTEM LOAD PRIMARY KEY` for loading the primary indexes of all parts in a specified table or for all tables if no table is specified. This can be useful for benchmarking and to prevent extra latency during query execution. [#67733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67733) ([ZAWA_ll](https://github.com/Zawa-ll)).
* [The Iceberg data storage](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#file-system-operations) format provides the user with extensive options for modifying the schema of their table. In this pull request, reading a table in Iceberg format has been implemented, where the order of columns, column names, and simple type extensions have been changed. [#69445](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69445) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Add function `toUnixTimestamp64Second` which converts a `DateTime64` to a `Int64` value with fixed second precision, so we can support return negative value if date is before 00:00:00 UTC on Thursday, 1 January 1970. [#70597](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70597) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Add new setting `enforce_index_structure_match_on_partition_manipulation` to allow attach when source table's projections and secondary indices is a subset of those in the target table. Close [#70602](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70602). [#70603](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70603) ([zwy991114](https://github.com/zwy991114)).
* The output of function `cast` differs with Apache Spark which cause difference in gluten project, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-gluten/issues/7602 This PR adds Spark text output format support feature, default closed. [#70957](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70957) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* This PR introduces a new setting `allow_experimental_reverse_key` that enables support for descending sort order in MergeTree sorting keys. This is useful for time series analysis, especially TopN queries. Example usage: ```sql CREATE TABLE example ( time DateTime, key Int32, value String ) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY (time DESC, key); -- Descending order for 'time' field SETTINGS allow_experimental_reverse_key = 1;. [#71095](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71095) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Integrate with Iceberg REST Catalog. [#71542](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71542) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Added an option to select the side of the join that will act as the inner (build) table in the query plan. This is controlled by `query_plan_join_swap_table`, which can be set to `auto`. In this mode, ClickHouse will try to choose the table with the smallest number of rows. [#71577](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71577) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Add syntax ALTER USER {ADD|MODIFY|DROP SETTING}, ALTER USER {ADD|DROP PROFILE}, the same for ALTER ROLE and ALTER PROFILE. [#72050](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72050) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Added `arrayPrAUC` function, which calculates the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the Precision Recall curve. [#72073](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72073) ([Emmanuel](https://github.com/emmanuelsdias)).
* Added cache for primary index of `MergeTree` tables (can be enabled by table setting `use_primary_key_cache`). If lazy load and cache are enabled for primary index, it will be loaded to cache on demand (similar to mark cache) instead of keeping it in memory forever. Added prewarm of primary index on inserts/mergs/fetches of data parts and on restarts of table (can be enabled by setting `prewarm_primary_key_cache`). [#72102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72102) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Backported in [#73593](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73593): `SELECT` and `VIEW` statements now support aliases, e.g. `SELECT b FROM (SELECT number, number*2 FROM numbers(2)) AS x (a, b);`. This enables TPC-H query 15 to run without modifications. [#72480](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72480) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Add indexOfAssumeSorted function for array types. Optimizes the search in the case of a sorted in non-decreasing order array. [#72517](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72517) ([Eric Kurbanov](https://github.com/erickurbanov)).
* Allows to use a delimiter as a optional second argument for aggregate function `groupConcat`. [#72540](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72540) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* A new setting, `http_response_headers` which allows you to customize the HTTP response headers. For example, you can tell the browser to render a picture that is stored in the database. This closes [#59620](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59620). [#72656](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72656) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add function `fromUnixTimestamp64Second` which converts a Int64 Unix timestamp value to a DateTime64. [#73146](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73146) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Memory usage of `clickhouse disks remove --recursive` is reduced for object storage disks. [#67323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67323) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* Enable JIT compilation for more expressions: abs/bitCount/sign/modulo/pmod/isNull/isNotNull/assumeNotNull/to(U)Int*/toFloat*, comparison functions(=, <, >, >=, <=), logical functions(and, or). [#70598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70598) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Now `parallel_hash` algorithm will be used (if applicable) when `join_algorithm` setting is set to `default`. Two previous alternatives (`direct` and `hash`) are still considered when `parallel_hash` cannot be used. [#70788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70788) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Add option to extract common expressions from `WHERE` and `ON` expressions in order to reduce the number of hash tables used during joins. Can be enabled by `optimize_extract_common_expressions = 1`. [#71537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71537) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Allows to use indexes on `SELECT` with `LowCardinality(String)`. [#71598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71598) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* During query execution with parallel replicas and enabled local plan, skip index analysis on workers. The coordinator will choose ranges to read for workers based on index analysis on its side (on query initiator). [#72109](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72109) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Bring back optimization for reading subcolumns of single column in Compact parts from https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57631. It was deleted accidentally. [#72285](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72285) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Speedup sorting of `LowCardinality(String)` columns by de-virtualizing calls in comparator. [#72337](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72337) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Optimize function argMin/Max for some simple data types. [#72350](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72350) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Optimize locking with shared locks in the memory tracker to reduce lock contention. [#72375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72375) ([Jiebin Sun](https://github.com/jiebinn)).
* Add a new setting, `use_async_executor_for_materialized_views`. Use async and potentially multithreaded execution of materialized view query, can speedup views processing during INSERT, but also consume more memory. [#72497](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72497) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Default values for settings `max_size_to_preallocate_for_aggregation`, `max_size_to_preallocate_for_joins` were further increased to `10^12`, so the optimisation will be applied in more cases. [#72555](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72555) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Improved performance of deserialization of states of aggregate functions (in data type `AggregateFunction` and in distributed queries). Slightly improved performance of parsing of format `RowBinary`. [#72818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72818) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

#### Improvement
* Adding a new cancellation logic: `CancellationChecker` checks timeouts for every started query and stops them once the timeout has reached. [#69880](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69880) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Remove the `allow_experimental_join_condition` setting, allowing non-equi conditions by default. [#69910](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69910) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Settings from server config (users.xml) now apply on the client too. Useful for format settings, e.g. `date_time_output_format`. [#71178](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71178) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Fixes [#71227](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71227). [#71286](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71286) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Automatic `GROUP BY`/`ORDER BY` to disk based on the server/user memory usage. Controlled with `max_bytes_ratio_before_external_group_by`/`max_bytes_ratio_before_external_sort` query settings. [#71406](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71406) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Function `translate` now supports character deletion if the `from` argument contains more characters than the `to` argument. Example: `SELECT translate('clickhouse', 'clickhouse', 'CLICK')` now returns `CLICK`. [#71441](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71441) ([shuai.xu](https://github.com/shuai-xu)).
* Support ALTER from Object to JSON. [#71784](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71784) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Split ranges in `MergeTreeReadPoolParallelReplicasInOrder` to consume less memory during reading. [#72173](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72173) ([JIaQi](https://github.com/JiaQiTang98)).
* Respect `prefer_locahost_replica` when building plan for distributed `INSERT ... SELECT`. [#72190](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72190) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* The problem is [described here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72091). Azure Iceberg Writer creates Iceberg metadata files (as well as manifest files) that violate specs. In this PR I added an attempt to read v1 iceberg format metadata with v2 reader (cause they write it in a this way), and added error when they didn't create corresponding fields in a manifest file. [#72277](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72277) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Move JSON/Dynamic/Variant types from experimental features to beta. [#72294](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72294) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Now it's allowed to `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` with `UNION [ALL]` in query. Behavior is the same as for matview with `JOIN`: **only first table in `SELECT` expression will work as trigger for insert** , all other tables will be ignored. [#72347](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72347) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Speed up insertions into merge tree in case of a single value of partition key inside inserted batch. [#72348](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72348) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* All small utilities previously stored in `/utils` folder and required manual compilation from sources are now a part of main ClickHouse bundle. This closes: [#72404](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72404). [#72426](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72426) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Implement creating tables in parallel while restoring from a backup. Before this PR the `RESTORE` command always created tables in one thread, which could be slow in case of backups containing many tables. [#72427](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72427) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add the new MergeTreeIndexGranularityInternalArraysTotalSize metric to system.metrics. This metric is needed to find the instances with huge datasets susceptible to the high memory usage issue. [#72490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72490) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Added source query validation when ClickHouse is used as a source for a dictionary. [#72548](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72548) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Ensure that ClickHouse will see ZooKeeper changes on config reloads. [#72593](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72593) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Better memory usage approximation of cached marks to reduce total memory usage of the cache. [#72630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72630) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add a new `StartupScriptsExecutionState` metric. The metric can have three values: 0 = startup scripts have not finished yet, 1 = startup scripts executed successfully, 2 = startup scripts failed. We need this metric because we need to know if startup scripts are being executed successfully in the cloud, especially after releases to base configurations. [#72637](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72637) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Backported in [#73472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73472): Support subcolumns in MergeTree sorting key and skip indexes. [#72644](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72644) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* All spellings of word `Null` now recognised when query uses `Format Null`. Previously other forms (e.g. `NULL`) did not result in exceptions being thrown, but at the same time format `Null` wasn't actually used in those cases. [#72658](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72658) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Add retries to creating a replicated table. [#72682](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72682) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Allow unknown values in set that are not present in Enum. Fix [#72662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72662). [#72686](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72686) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Add total_bytes_with_inactive to system.tables to count the total bytes of inactive parts. [#72690](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72690) ([Kai Zhu](https://github.com/nauu)).
* Add MergeTreeSettings to system.settings_changes. [#72694](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72694) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Support string search operator(eg. like) for Enum data type, fix [#72661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72661). [#72732](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72732) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* Support JSON type in notEmpty function. [#72741](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72741) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support parsing GCS S3 error `AuthenticationRequired`. [#72753](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72753) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support Dynamic type in functions ifNull and coalesce. [#72772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72772) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add S3 request settings `http_max_fields`, `http_max_field_name_size`, `http_max_field_value_size` and use them while parsing S3 API responses during making a backup or restoring. [#72778](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72778) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Delete table metadata in keeper in Storage S3(Azure)Queue only after last table using this metadata is dropped. [#72810](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72810) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Added `JoinBuildTableRowCount/JoinProbeTableRowCount/JoinResultRowCount` profile events. [#72842](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72842) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* From now if `compress` option is specified for a table of `Memory` engine, data will always be compressed as soon as compressed representation is at least one byte smaller than the original data. Previously it was required to be at least twice smaller. [#72895](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72895) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Support Dynamic in functions toFloat64/touInt32/etc. [#72989](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72989) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#73470](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73470): Improve extraction of common expression in disjunctions. Allow simplifying the resulting filter expression even if there's no common subexpression for all the disjuncts. Continuation of [#71537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71537). [#73271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73271) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Backported in [#73389](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73389): Introduce a setting `least_greatest_legacy_null_behavior` (default: `false`) which controls if functions `least` and `greatest` handle `NULL` arguments by unconditionally returning `NULL` (if `true`) or by ignoring them (if `false`). [#73344](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73344) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Backported in [#73449](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73449): Use Keeper multi requests in cleanup thread ObjectStorageQueueMetadata. [#73357](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73357) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Backported in [#73476](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73476): A new MongoDB driver is now the default. Users who like to continue using the legacy driver can set server setting `use_legacy_mongodb_integration` to true. [#73359](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73359) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Backported in [#73437](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73437): When ClickHouse runs under cgroup we will still collect system-wide asynchronous metrics related to system load, process scheduling, memory etc. They might provide useful signals when ClickHouse is the only process on the host with high resource consumption. [#73369](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73369) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).

* Dropping mark cache might take noticeable time if it is big. If we hold context mutex during this it block many other activities, even new client connection cannot be established until it is released. And holding this mutex is not actually required for synchronization, it is enough to have a local reference to the cache via shared ptr.

* PK cache was heavily underestimating it's size on one of the test instances. In particular LowCardinality columns were not including dictionary size.
