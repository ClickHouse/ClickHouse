### ClickHouse release v21.4.4.30-stable FIXME as compared to v21.4.3.21-stable

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Backported in [#23145](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23145): Now replicas that are processing the `ALTER TABLE ATTACH PART[ITION]` command search in their `detached/` folders before fetching the data from other replicas. As an implementation detail, a new command `ATTACH_PART` is introduced in the replicated log. Parts are searched and compared by their checksums. [#18978](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/18978) ([Mike Kot](https://github.com/myrrc)).

#### New Feature
* Backported in [#23147](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23147): Improved performance of `dictGetHierarchy`, `dictIsIn` functions. Added functions `dictGetChildren(dictionary, key)`, `dictGetDescendants(dictionary, key, level)`. Function `dictGetChildren` return all children as an array if indexes. It is a inverse transformation for `dictGetHierarchy`. Function `dictGetDescendants` return all descendants as if `dictGetChildren` was applied `level` times recursively. Zero `level` value is equivalent to infinity. Closes [#14656](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14656). [#22096](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22096) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Backported in [#23146](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23146): Added function `dictGetOrNull`. It works like `dictGet`, but return `Null` in case key was not found in dictionary. Closes [#22375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22375). [#22413](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22413) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).

* Backported in [#23016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23016): Set `background_fetches_pool_size` to 8 that is better for production usage with frequent small insertions or slow ZooKeeper cluster. [#22945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22945) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
