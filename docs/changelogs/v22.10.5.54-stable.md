# 2023 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v22.10.5.54-stable (dbc7984dc3b) FIXME as compared to v22.10.4.23-stable (352772987f4)

#### Bug Fix
* Backported in [#43100](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/43100): Updated normaliser to clone the alias ast. resolves [#42452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/42452) Implementation: * Updated QueryNormalizer to clone alias ast, when its replaced. Previously just assigning the same leads to exception in LogicalExpressinsOptimizer as it would be the same parent being inserted again. * This bug is not seen with new analyser (allow_experimental_analyzer), so no changes for it.
