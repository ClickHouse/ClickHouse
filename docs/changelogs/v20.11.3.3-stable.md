* Backported in [#16891](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16891): Fix rare silent crashes when query profiler is on and ClickHouse is installed on OS with glibc version that has (supposedly) broken asynchronous unwind tables for some functions. This fixes [#15301](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15301). This fixes [#13098](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13098). [#16846](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16846) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
