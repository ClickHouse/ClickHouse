# 2023 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v23.2.4.12-stable (8fe866cb035) FIXME as compared to v23.2.3.17-stable (dec18bf7281)

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in official stable release)

* Backported in [#47277](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47277): Fix IPv4/IPv6 serialization/deserialization in binary formats that was broken in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/43221. Closes [#46522](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/46522). [#46616](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46616) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Backported in [#47212](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47212): `INSERT` queries through native TCP protocol and HTTP protocol were not canceled correctly in some cases. It could lead to a partially applied query if a client canceled the query, or if a client died or, in rare cases, on network errors. As a result, it could lead to not working deduplication. Fixes [#27667](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/27667) and [#45377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/45377). [#46681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/46681) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Backported in [#47363](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47363): Fix possible deadlock on distributed query cancellation. [#47161](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47161) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
