### ClickHouse release v20.10.4.1-stable FIXME as compared to v20.10.3.30-stable

#### Improvement
* Workaround for use S3 with nginx server as proxy. Nginx currenty does not accept urls with empty path like http://domain.com?delete, but vanilla aws-sdk-cpp produces this kind of urls. This commit uses patched aws-sdk-cpp version, which makes urls with "/" as path in this cases, like http://domain.com/?delete.

#### Bug Fix
* Backported in [#16492](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16492): Fix bug with MySQL database. When MySQL server used as database engine is down some queries raise Exception, because they try to get tables from disabled server, while it's unnecessary. For example, query `SELECT ... FROM system.parts` should work only with MergeTree tables and don't touch MySQL database at all.
