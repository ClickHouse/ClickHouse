# 2025 Changelog

### ClickHouse release v25.1.8.25-stable (990179ead8b) FIXME as compared to v25.1.7.20-stable (dcc6b0a7384)

#### New Feature
* Backported in [#77357](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/77357): Added `concurrent_threads_scheduler` server setting that governs how CPU slots are distributed among concurrent queries. Could be set to `round_robin` (previous behavior) or `fair_round_robin` to address the issue of unfair CPU distribution between INSERTs and SELECTs.

#### Improvement
* Backported in [#77202](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/77202): Previously database replicated might print credentials specified in a query to logs. This behaviour is fixed. This closes: [#77123](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/77123). [#77133](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77133) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
