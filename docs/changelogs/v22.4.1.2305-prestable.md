### ClickHouse release v22.4.1.2305-prestable FIXME as compared to v22.3.1.1262-prestable

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Function `yandexConsistentHash` (consistent hashing algorithm by Konstantin "kostik" Oblakov) is renamed to `kostikConsistentHash`. The old name is left as an alias for compatibility. Although this change is backward compatible, we may remove the alias in subsequent releases, that's why it's recommended to update the usages of this function in your apps. [#35553](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35553) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Do not allow SETTINGS after FORMAT for INSERT queries (there is compatibility setting `parser_settings_after_format_compact` to accept such queries, but it is turned OFF by default). [#35883](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35883) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Changed hashed path for cache files. [#36079](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36079) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

#### New Feature
* Added support for transactions for simple `MergeTree` tables. This feature is highly experimental and not recommended for production. Part of [#22086](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/22086). [#24258](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/24258) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

* Profiling on Processors level (under `log_processors_profiles` setting, ClickHouse will write time that processor spent during execution/waiting for data to `system.processors_profile_log` table). [#34355](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34355) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add `toEndOfMonth` function which rounds up a date or date with time to the last day of the month. [#33501](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/33501). [#34394](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34394) ([Habibullah Oladepo](https://github.com/holadepo)).
* Add `h3PointDistM`, `h3PointDistKm`, `h3PointDistRads`, `h3GetRes0Indexes`, `h3GetPentagonIndexes` functions. [#34568](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34568) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).

* Added functions `arrayFirstOrNull`, `arrayLastOrNull`. Closes [#35238](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35238). [#35414](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35414) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Allow to write remote fs cache on all write operations. Add `system.remote_filesystem_cache` table. Add `drop remote filesystem cache` query. Add introspection for s3 metadata with `system.remote_data_paths` table. Closes [#34021](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34021). Add cache option for merges by adding mode `read_from_filesystem_cache_if_exists_otherwise_bypass_cache` (turned on by default for merges and can also be turned on by query setting with the same name). Rename cache related settings (`remote_fs_enable_cache -> enable_filesystem_cache`, etc). [#35475](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35475) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Added functions makeDate(year, month, day), makeDate32(year, month, day). [#35628](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35628) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Added function `flattenTuple`. It receives nested named `Tuple` as an argument and returns a flatten `Tuple` which elements are the paths from the original `Tuple`. E.g.: `Tuple(a Int, Tuple(b Int, c Int)) -> Tuple(a Int, b Int, c Int)`. `flattenTuple` can be used to select all paths from type `Object` as separate columns. [#35690](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35690) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Support new type of quota `WRITTEN BYTES` to limit amount of written bytes during insert queries. [#35736](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35736) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

* ... [#36436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36436) ([Rich Raposa](https://github.com/rfraposa)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Speed up parts loading process of MergeTree to accelerate starting up of clickhouse-server. With this improvement, clickhouse-server was able to decrease starting up time from 75 minutes to 20 seconds, with 700k mergetree parts. [#32928](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/32928) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Sizes of hash tables used during aggregation now collected and used in later queries to avoid hash tables resizes. [#33439](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33439) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Multiple changes to improve ASOF join performance (1.2 - 1.6x as fast). It also adds support to use big integers. [#34733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34733) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* URL storage engine now downloads multiple chunks in parallel if the endpoint supports HTTP Range. Two additional settings were added, `max_download_threads` and `max_download_buffer_size`, which control maximum number of threads a single query can use to download the file and the maximum number of bytes each thread can process. [#35150](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35150) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* parallelization of multipart upload into S3 storage. [#35343](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35343) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Improve performance of ASOF JOIN if key is native integer. [#35525](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35525) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* A new query plan optimization. Evaluate functions after `ORDER BY` when possible. As an example, for a query `SELECT sipHash64(number) FROM numbers(1e8) ORDER BY number LIMIT 5`, function `sipHash64` would be evaluated after `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, which gives ~20x speed up. [#35623](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35623) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* narrow mutex scope when setenv LIBHDFS3_CONF related issue [#35292](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35292). [#35646](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35646) ([shuchaome](https://github.com/shuchaome)).

* - The explain statement of GLOBAL JOIN two distributed tables can speed up 100x: explain plan select ... from t1_dist global join t2_dist on ... explain pipeline select ... from t1_dist global join t2_dist on ... [#36055](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36055) ([何李夫](https://github.com/helifu)).
* 2 optimizations: - Optimize trivail count hive query - Speed up hive query by caching metadata of hive file. [#36082](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36082) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).

* As talked in [issue 27025](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/27025), there is an improvement of the HasAll function using SIMD instruction (SSE and AVX2). Gtest tests have also been added. [#27653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/27653) ([youennL-cs](https://github.com/youennL-cs)).
* Proper support of setting `max_rows_to_read` in case of reading in order of sorting key and specified limit. Previously the exception `Limit for rows or bytes to read exceeded` could be thrown even if query actually requires to read less amount of rows. [#33230](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/33230) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* INTERVAL improvement - can be used with `[MILLI|MICRO|NANO]SECOND`. Added `toStartOf[Milli|Micro|Nano]second()` functions. Added `[add|subtract][Milli|Micro|Nano]second()`. [#34353](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34353) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).

* added sanity checks on server startup (available memory and disk space, max thread count, etc). [#34566](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34566) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Use minmax index for orc/parquet file in Hive Engine. Related pr: https://github.com/ClickHouse-Extras/arrow/pull/10. [#34631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34631) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* If `port` is not specified in cluster configuration, default server port will be used. This closes [#34769](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34769). [#34772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34772) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Add function `getTypeSerializationStreams`. For a specified type (which is detected from column), it returns an array with all the serialization substream paths. This function is useful mainly for developers. [#35290](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35290) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* - wchc operation is expensive and should not be in the four_letter_word_white_list defaults. [#35320](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35320) ([zhangyuli1](https://github.com/zhangyuli1)).
* Added an ability to specify cluster secret in replicated database. [#35333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35333) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Add a new kind of row policies named `simple`. Before this PR we had two kinds or row policies: `permissive` and `restrictive`. A `simple` row policy adds a new filter on a table without any side-effects like it was for permissive and restrictive policies. [#35345](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35345) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Remove testmode option, enable it unconditionally. [#35354](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35354) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* For table function `s3cluster` or `HDFSCluster` or `hive`, we can't get right `AccessType` by `StorageFactory::instance().getSourceAccessType(getStorageTypeName())`. This pr fix it. [#35365](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35365) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).

* Add sizes of subcolumns to `system.parts_columns` table. [#35488](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35488) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* It was possible to get stack overflow in distributed queries if one of the settings `async_socket_for_remote` and `use_hedged_requests` is enabled while parsing very deeply nested data type (at least in debug build). Closes [#35509](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35509). [#35524](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35524) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Added a support for automatic schema inference to `s3Cluster` table function. Synced the signatures of `s3 ` and `s3Cluster`. [#35544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35544) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Use multiple threads to download objects from S3. Downloading is controllable using `max_download_threads` and `max_download_buffer_size` settings. [#35571](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35571) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Deduce absolute hdfs config path. [#35572](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35572) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* - Use some tweaks and heuristics to determine numbers, strings, arrays, tuples and maps in CSV, TSV and TSVRaw data formats. Add setting `input_format_csv_use_best_effort_in_schema_inference` for CSV format that enables/disables using these heuristics, if it's disabled, we treat everything as string. Add similar setting `input_format_tsv_use_best_effort_in_schema_inference` for TSV/TSVRaw format. These settings are enabled by default. - Add Maps support for schema inference in Values format. - Fix possible segfault in schema inference in Values format. - Allow to skip columns with unsupported types in Arrow/ORC/Parquet formats. Add corresponding settings for it: `input_format_{parquet|orc|arrow}_skip_columns_with_unsupported_types_in_schema_inference`. These settings are disabled by default. - Allow to convert a column with type Null to a Nullable column with all NULL values in Arrow/Parquet formats. - Allow to specify column names in schema inference via setting `column_names_for_schema_inference` for formats that don't contain column names (like CSV, TSV, JSONCompactEachRow, etc) - Fix schema inference in ORC/Arrow/Parquet formats in terms of working with Nullable columns. Previously all inferred types were not Nullable and it blocked reading Nullable columns from data, now it's fixed and all inferred types are always Nullable (because we cannot understand that column is Nullable or not by reading the schema). - Fix schema inference in Template format with CSV escaping rules. [#35582](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35582) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Improve columns ordering in schema inference for formats TSKV and JSONEachRow, closes [#35640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35640). Don't stop schema inference when reading empty row in schema inference for formats TSKV and JSONEachRow. [#35724](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35724) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add new setting `input_format_json_read_bools_as_numbers` that allows to infer and parse bools as numbers in JSON input formats. It's enabled by default. Suggested by @alexey-milovidov. [#35735](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35735) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Respect remote_url_allow_hosts for hive. [#35743](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35743) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Support schema inference for insert select with using `input` table function. Get schema from insertion table instead of inferring it from the data in case of insert select from table functions that support schema inference. Closes [#35639](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35639). [#35760](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35760) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Added an animation to the hourglass icon to indicate to the user that a query is running. [#35860](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35860) ([peledni](https://github.com/peledni)).
* Now some `ALTER MODIFY COLUMN` queries for `Arrays` and `Nullable` types can be done at metadata level without mutations. For example, alter from `Array(Enum8('Option1'=1))` to `Array(Enum8('Option1'=1, 'Option2'=2))`. [#35882](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35882) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Now it's not allowed to `ALTER TABLE ... RESET SETTING` for non-existing settings for MergeTree engines family. Fixes [#35816](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35816). [#35884](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35884) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

* ASTPartition::formatImpl should output ALL while executing ALTER TABLE t DETACH PARTITION ALL. [#35987](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35987) ([awakeljw](https://github.com/awakeljw)).
* `clickhouse-keeper` starts answering 4-letter commands before getting the quorum. [#35992](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35992) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Fix wrong assertion in replxx which happens when navigating back the history when the first line of input is a newline. Mark as improvement because it only affects debug build. This fixes [#34511](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34511). [#36007](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36007) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

* Fix error while moving table with `JOIN` engine from `Ordinary` database to `Atomic`, close [#35686](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35686). [#35995](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/35995) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Fix error `Empty list of columns in SELECT query` in CROSS JOIN close [#35672](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35672). [#36033](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36033) ([Vladimir C](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Fix possible incorrect result of `WINDOW` functions in queries with `LIMIT` which was caused by wrong limit-push-down query plan optimization. Fixes [#36071](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/36071) and [#23125](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23125). [#36075](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36075) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Throw an exception when CH cannot execute a file instead of displaying success and silently failing. [#36088](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36088) ([Julian Gilyadov](https://github.com/israelg99)).
* Fix window view when is proc time and window kind larger than day, see code comment. [#36109](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36109) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Fix bug of read buffer from hdfs. ReadBufferFromHDFSImpl::offset was misused as offset of working_buffer, but it is file offset. cc @kssenii. [#36153](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36153) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Fix crash in ParallelReadBuffer. [#36169](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36169) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow to convert empty strings to empty values of type `Objects`. [#36179](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36179) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fix possible segfault in schema inference for JSON formats. [#36195](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36195) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* `CREATE TABLE ... AS` might fail with `Replica ... already exists` even if `ReplicatedMergeTree` table was created with default arguments. It's fixed. Now `{uuid}` macro is not unfolded when saving table metadata. Therefore, it's not allowed to move `ReplicatedMergeTree` table from `Atomic` to `Ordinary` database if `zookeeper_path` contains `{uuid}` macro (or table was created with default engine arguments). Fixes [#35577](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35577). [#36200](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36200) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Fix reading of empty arrays in reverse order (in queries with descending sorting by prefix of primary key). [#36215](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36215) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Play UI was not able to display some resultsets, for example `SELECT * FROM dish`. [#36283](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36283) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
