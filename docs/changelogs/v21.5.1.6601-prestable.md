### ClickHouse release v21.5.1.6601-prestable FIXME as compared to v21.4.1.6422-prestable

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Change comparison of integers and floating point numbers when integer is not exactly representable in the floating point data type. In new version comparison will return false as the rounding error will occur. Example: `9223372036854775808.0 != 9223372036854775808`, because the number `9223372036854775808` is not representable as floating point number exactly (and `9223372036854775808.0` is rounded to `9223372036854776000.0`). But in previous version the comparison will return as the numbers are equal, because if the floating point number `9223372036854776000.0` get converted back to UInt64, it will yield `9223372036854775808`. For the reference, the Python programming language also treats these numbers as equal. But this behaviour was dependend on CPU model (different results on AMD64 and AArch64 for some out-of-range numbers), so we make the comparison more precise. It will treat int and float numbers equal only if int is represented in floating point type exactly. [#22595](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22595) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### New Feature
* Implement function `arrayFold(x1,...,xn,accum -> expression, array1,...,arrayn, init_accum)` that applies the expression to each element of the array (or set of parallel arrays) and collect result in accumulator. [#21589](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21589) ([Dmitry Krylov](https://github.com/dmalkr)).
* - Support Apple m1. [#21639](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21639) ([changvvb](https://github.com/changvvb)).
* Add a setting `max_distributed_depth` that limits the depth of recursive queries to `Distributed` tables. Closes [#20229](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/20229). [#21942](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/21942) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Table function, which allows to process files from `s3` in parallel from many nodes in a specified cluster. [#22012](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/22012) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
