# Quick Start

ClickHouse can run on any Linux, FreeBSD, or Mac OS X with x86_64, AArch64, or PowerPC64LE CPU architecture. Follow these steps
to get up and running with ClickHouse:

##  1. Start ClickHouse
  
1. The simplest way to download ClickHouse locally is to run the following command. If your operating system is supported, an appropriate ClickHouse binary will be downloaded and made executable:
    ```bash
    curl https://clickhouse.com/ | sh
    ```

2. Run the following command to start the ClickHouse server:
    ```bash
    ./clickhouse server
    ```

    :::note
    If your OS is not supported or for other install options, view the [installation details in the technical reference guide](./en/getting-started/install/).
    :::


## 2. Connect to ClickHouse 

1. The ClickHouse server listens for HTTP clients on port 8123 by default. There is a built-in UI for running SQL queries at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8123/play" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8123/play</a> (change the hostname accordingly). 

    <img src={require('./images/quickstart_01.png').default} class="image" alt="The Play UI" />

    :::note
    The default username for accessing ClickHouse is **default** and there is no password defined initially for the 
    **default** user. Notice in your Play UI that the username was populated with **default** and the password text field was left empty.
    :::

2. Try running a query. For example, the following returns the names of the predefined databases:

    ```sql 
    SHOW databases
    ```

3. Click the **RUN** button and the response is displayed in the lower portion of the Play UI:

    <img src={require('./images/quickstart_02.png').default} class="image" alt="View the results" />

## 3. Create a Table 

1. As in most databases management systems, ClickHouse logically groups tables into **databases**. Use the `CREATE DATABASE` command to create a new database in ClickHouse:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS helloworld
    ```

2. Even the simplest of tables in ClickHouse must specify a **table engine**. The engine determines details about the table like:
    - how and where the data is stored, 
    - which queries are supported, and 
    - whether or not the data is replicated. 

    There are many engines to choose from, but for a simple table on a single-node ClickHouse server, 
    [MergeTree](./en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree.md) is your likely choice. Run the following command to create a table named `my_first_table` in the `helloworld` database:
    ```sql 
    CREATE TABLE helloworld.my_first_table
    (
        user_id UInt32,
        message String,
        timestamp DateTime,
        metric Float32
    )
    ENGINE = MergeTree()
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, timestamp)
    ```

### A Brief Intro to Primary Keys

Before you go any further, it is important to understand how primary keys work in ClickHouse (the implementation 
of primary keys might seem unexpected!): 

- primary keys in ClickHouse are **_not unique_** for each row in a table

The primary key of a ClickHouse table determines how the data is sorted when written to disk. Every 8,192 rows or 10MB of 
data (referred to as the **index granularity**) creates an entry in the primary key index file. This granularity concept 
creates a **sparse index** that can easily fit in memory, and the granules represent a stripe of the smallest amount of 
column data that gets processed during `SELECT` queries. 

The primary key can be defined using the `PRIMARY KEY` command. If you define a table without a `PRIMARY KEY` specified, 
then the key becomes the tuple specified in the `ORDER BY` clause. If you specify both a `PRIMARY KEY ` and an `ORDER BY`, the primary key must be a subset of the sort order.

In the example above, `my_first_table` is a MergeTree table with four columns:

- `user_id`:  a 32-bit unsigned integer
- `message`: a String data type, which replaces types like VARCHAR, BLOB, CLOB and others from other database systems
- `timestamp`: a DateTime value, which represents an instant in time
- `metric`: a 32-bit floating point number

The primary key is also the sorting key, which is a tuple of `(user_id, timestamp)`.  Therefore, the data stored in each 
column file will be sorted by `user_id`, then `timestamp`.  

## 4. Insert Data 

You can use the familiar `INSERT INTO TABLE` command with ClickHouse, but it is important to understand that each insert into a `MergeTree` table causes a **part** to be created in storage. 

The best practice with ClickHouse is to insert a large number of rows per batch - tens of thousands or even millions of 
rows at once. (Don't worry - ClickHouse can easily handle that type of volume!) 

1. Even for a simple example, let's insert more than one row at a time:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO helloworld.my_first_table (user_id, message, timestamp, metric) VALUES
        (101, 'Hello, ClickHouse!',                                 now(),       -1.0    ),
        (102, 'Insert a lot of rows per batch',                     yesterday(), 1.41421 ),
        (102, 'Sort your data based on your commonly-used queries', today(),     2.718   ),
        (101, 'Granules are the smallest chunks of data read',      now() + 5,   3.14159 )
    ```
    :::note
    Notice the `timestamp` column is populated using various **Date** and **DateTime** functions. ClickHouse has hundreds of useful
    functions <a href="./en/sql-reference/functions/" target="_blank">that you can view in the **Functions** section of the docs</a>.
    :::

2. Let's verify it worked:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM helloworld.my_first_table
    ```
    You should see the four rows of data that were inserted:
    <img src={require('./images/quickstart_03.png').default} class="image" alt="New rows inserted" />


## 5. The ClickHouse Client 


1. You can also connect to your ClickHouse server using a command-line tool named **clickhouse client**. Open a new terminal and change directories to where you downloaded the `clickhouse` binary in step 1 above, then run the following command:
    ```bash
    ./clickhouse client
    ```
 
2. If you get the smiley face prompt, you are ready to run queries! 
    ```sql
    :)
    ```

    Give it a try by running the following query:
    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM helloworld.my_first_table 
    ORDER BY timestamp
    ```

    Notice the response comes back in a nice table format:
    ```response
    SELECT *
    FROM helloworld.my_first_table
    ORDER BY timestamp ASC

    Query id: f7a33012-bc8c-4f0f-9641-260ee1ffe4b8

    ┌─user_id─┬─message────────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────timestamp─┬──metric─┐
    │     102 │ Insert a lot of rows per batch                     │ 2022-03-21 00:00:00 │ 1.41421 │
    │     102 │ Sort your data based on your commonly-used queries │ 2022-03-22 00:00:00 │   2.718 │
    │     101 │ Hello, ClickHouse!                                 │ 2022-03-22 14:04:09 │      -1 │
    │     101 │ Granules are the smallest chunks of data read      │ 2022-03-22 14:04:14 │ 3.14159 │
    └─────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴─────────┘

    4 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.008 sec.
    ```

3. Add a `FORMAT` clause to specify one of the <a href="./en/interfaces/formats/" target="_blank">many supported output formats of ClickHouse</a>:
    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM helloworld.my_first_table 
    ORDER BY timestamp 
    FORMAT TabSeparated
    ```
    In the above query, the output is returned as tab-separated:
    ```response
    Query id: 3604df1c-acfd-4117-9c56-f86c69721121

    102	Insert a lot of rows per batch	2022-03-21 00:00:00	1.41421
    102	Sort your data based on your commonly-used queries	2022-03-22 00:00:00	2.718
    101	Hello, ClickHouse!	2022-03-22 14:04:09	-1
    101	Granules are the smallest chunks of data read	2022-03-22 14:04:14	3.14159

    4 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.005 sec.
    ```

4. To exit the `clickhouse client`, enter the **exit** command:
    ```bash
    :) exit
    Bye.
    ```

## 6. Insert a CSV file

A common task when getting started with a database is to insert some data that you already have in files. We have some
sample data online that you can insert that represents clickstream data - it includes a user ID, a URL that was visited, and 
the timestamp of the event.

1. Suppose we have the following text in a CSV file named `data.csv`:
    ```
    102,This is data in a file,2022-02-22 10:43:28,123.45
    101,It is comma-separated,2022-02-23 00:00:00,456.78
    103,Use FORMAT to specify the format,2022-02-21 10:43:30,678.90
    ```

2. The following command inserts the data into `my_first_table`:
    ``` bash
    ./clickhouse client --query='INSERT INTO helloworld.my_first_table FORMAT CSV' < data.csv
    ```

3. Notice the new rows appear in the table now:
