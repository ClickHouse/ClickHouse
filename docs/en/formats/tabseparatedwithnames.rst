TabSeparatedWithNames
---------------------

Differs from the TabSeparated format in that the column names are output in the first row.
For parsing, the first row is completely ignored. You can't use column names to determine their position or to check their correctness.
(Support for using header while parsing could be added in future.)

It's also available as ``TSVWithNames``.
