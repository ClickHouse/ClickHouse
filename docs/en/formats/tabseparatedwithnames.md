# TabSeparatedWithNames

Differs from the `TabSeparated` format in that the column names are written in the first row.
During parsing, the first row is completely ignored. You can't use column names to determine their position or to check their correctness.
(Support for parsing the header row may be added in the future.)

This format is also available under the name ` TSVWithNames`.
