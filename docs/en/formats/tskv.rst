In case of many small columns this format is obviously not effective and there usually is no reason to use it. This format is supported because it is used for some cases in Yandex.

Format is supported both for input and output. In INSERT queries data can be supplied with arbitrary order of columns. It is also possible to omit values in which case the default value of the column is inserted. N.B. when using TSKV format, complex default values are not supported, so when omitting a column its value will be zeros or empty string depending on its type.
