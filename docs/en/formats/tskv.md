# TSKV

Similar to TabSeparated, but outputs a value in name=value format. Names are escaped the same way as in TabSeparated format, and the = symbol is also escaped.

```text
SearchPhrase=   count()=8267016
SearchPhrase=bathroom interior design    count()=2166
SearchPhrase=yandex     count()=1655
SearchPhrase=spring 2014 fashion    count()=1549
SearchPhrase=freeform photos       count()=1480
SearchPhrase=angelina jolia    count()=1245
SearchPhrase=omsk       count()=1112
SearchPhrase=photos of dog breeds    count()=1091
SearchPhrase=curtain design        count()=1064
SearchPhrase=baku       count()=1000
```

When there is a large number of small columns, this format is ineffective, and there is generally no reason to use it. It is used in some departments of Yandex.

Both data output and parsing are supported in this format. For parsing, any order is supported for the values of different columns. It is acceptable for some values to be omitted â€“ they are treated as equal to their default values. In this case, zeros and blank rows are used as default values. Complex values that could be specified in the table are not supported as defaults.

Parsing allows the presence of the additional field `tskv` without the equal sign or a value. This field is ignored.
