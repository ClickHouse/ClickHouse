TabSeparatedWithNamesAndTypes
-----------------------------

Differs from the ``TabSeparated`` format in that the column names are output to the first row, while the column types are in the second row.
For parsing, the first and second rows are completely ignored.

It's also available as ``TSVWithNamesAndTypes``.
