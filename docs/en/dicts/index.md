# Dictionaries

`A dictionary` is a mapping (key `->` attributes) that can be used in a query as functions.
You can think of this as a more convenient and efficient type of JOIN with dimension tables.

There are built-in (internal) and add-on (external) dictionaries.

```eval_rst
.. toctree::

   external_dicts
   internal_dicts

```
