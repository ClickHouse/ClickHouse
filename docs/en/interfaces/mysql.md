# MySQL Interface

ClickHouse supports the MySQL wire protocol. This allow tools that are MySQL-compatible to interact with ClickHouse seamlessly (e.g. [Looker Studio](../integrations/data-visualization/looker-studio-and-clickhouse.md)).

## Enabling the MySQL Interface On ClickHouse Cloud

1. After creating your ClickHouse Cloud Service, on the credentials screen, select the MySQL tab

![Credentials screen - Prompt](./images/mysql1.png)

2. Toggle the switch to enable the MySQL interface for this specific service. This will expose port `3306` for this service and prompt you with your MySQL connection screen that include your unique MySQL username. The password will be the same as the service's default user password.

Alternatively, in order to enable the MySQL interface for an existing service:

1. Ensure your service is in `Running` state then click on the "View connection string" button for the service you want to enable the MySQL interface for

2. Toggle the switch to enable the MySQL interface for this specific service. This will prompt you to enter the default password.

3. After entering the password, you will get prompted the MySQL connection string for this service

## Enabling the MySQL Interface On Self-managed ClickHouse

Add the [mysql_port](../operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings.md#server_configuration_parameters-mysql_port) setting to your server's configuration file. For example, you could define the port in a new XML file in your `config.d/` [folder](../operations/configuration-files):

``` xml
<clickhouse>
    <mysql_port>9004</mysql_port>
</clickhouse>
```

Startup your ClickHouse server and look for a log message similar to the following that mentions Listening for MySQL compatibility protocol:

```
{} <Information> Application: Listening for MySQL compatibility protocol: 127.0.0.1:9004
```

## Connect MySQL to ClickHouse

The following command demonstrates how to connect the MySQL client `mysql` to ClickHouse:

```bash
mysql --protocol tcp -h [hostname] -u [username] -P [port_number] [database_name]
```

For example:

``` bash
$ mysql --protocol tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -u default -P 9004 default
```

Output if a connection succeeded:

``` text
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 4

```

For compatibility with all MySQL clients, it is recommended to specify user password with [double SHA1](../operations/settings/settings-users.md#password_double_sha1_hex) in configuration file.
If user password is specified using [SHA256](../operations/settings/settings-users.md#password_sha256_hex), some clients wonâ€™t be able to authenticate (mysqljs and old versions of command-line tool MySQL and MariaDB).

Restrictions:

- prepared queries are not supported

- some data types are sent as strings

To cancel a long query use `KILL QUERY connection_id` statement (it is replaced with `KILL QUERY WHERE query_id = connection_id` while proceeding). For example:

``` bash
$ mysql --protocol tcp -h mysql_server -P 9004 default -u default --password=123 -e "KILL QUERY 123456;"
```
