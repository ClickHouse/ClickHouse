## Description

Prints each value on a separate line with the column name specified. This format is convenient for printing just one or a few rows if each row consists of a large number of columns.
[`NULL`](/docs/en/sql-reference/syntax.md) is output as `ᴺᵁᴸᴸ`.

## Example Usage

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t_null FORMAT Vertical
```

```response
Row 1:
──────
x: 1
y: ᴺᵁᴸᴸ
```

Rows are not escaped in Vertical format:

```sql
SELECT 'string with \'quotes\' and \t with some special \n characters' AS test FORMAT Vertical
```

```response
Row 1:
──────
test: string with 'quotes' and      with some special
 characters
```

This format is only appropriate for outputting a query result, but not for parsing (retrieving data to insert in a table).
