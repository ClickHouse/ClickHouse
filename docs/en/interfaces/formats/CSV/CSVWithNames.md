## Description {#description}

Also prints the header row with column names, similar to [TabSeparatedWithNames](/interfaces/formats/TabSeparatedWithNames).

## Example Usage {#example-usage}

### Inserting Data {#inserting-data}

:::tip
Starting from [version](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/releases) 23.1, ClickHouse will automatically detect headers in CSV files when using the `CSV` format, so it is not necessary to use `CSVWithNames` or `CSVWithNamesAndTypes`.
:::

Using the following CSV file, named as `football.csv`:

```csv
date,season,home_team,away_team,home_team_goals,away_team_goals
2022-04-30,2021,Sutton United,Bradford City,1,4
2022-04-30,2021,Swindon Town,Barrow,2,1
2022-04-30,2021,Tranmere Rovers,Oldham Athletic,2,0
2022-05-02,2021,Salford City,Mansfield Town,2,2
2022-05-02,2021,Port Vale,Newport County,1,2
2022-05-07,2021,Barrow,Northampton Town,1,3
2022-05-07,2021,Bradford City,Carlisle United,2,0
2022-05-07,2021,Bristol Rovers,Scunthorpe United,7,0

2022-05-07,2021,Stevenage Borough,Salford City,4,2
2022-05-07,2021,Walsall,Swindon Town,0,3
```

Create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE football
(
    `date` Date,
    `season` Int16,
    `home_team` LowCardinality(String),
    `away_team` LowCardinality(String),
    `home_team_goals` Int8,
    `away_team_goals` Int8
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (date, home_team);
```

Insert data using the `CSVWithNames` format:

```sql
INSERT INTO football FROM INFILE 'football.csv' FORMAT CSVWithNames;
```

### Reading Data {#reading-data}

Read data using the `CSVWithNames` format:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM football
FORMAT CSVWithNames
```

The output will be a CSV with a single header row:

```csv
"date","season","home_team","away_team","home_team_goals","away_team_goals"
"2022-04-30",2021,"Sutton United","Bradford City",1,4
"2022-04-30",2021,"Swindon Town","Barrow",2,1
"2022-04-30",2021,"Tranmere Rovers","Oldham Athletic",2,0
"2022-05-02",2021,"Port Vale","Newport County",1,2
"2022-05-02",2021,"Salford City","Mansfield Town",2,2
"2022-05-07",2021,"Barrow","Northampton Town",1,3
"2022-05-07",2021,"Bradford City","Carlisle United",2,0
"2022-05-07",2021,"Bristol Rovers","Scunthorpe United",7,0
"2022-05-07",2021,"Exeter City","Port Vale",0,1
"2022-05-07",2021,"Harrogate Town A.F.C.","Sutton United",0,2
"2022-05-07",2021,"Hartlepool United","Colchester United",0,2
"2022-05-07",2021,"Leyton Orient","Tranmere Rovers",0,1
"2022-05-07",2021,"Mansfield Town","Forest Green Rovers",2,2
"2022-05-07",2021,"Newport County","Rochdale",0,2
"2022-05-07",2021,"Oldham Athletic","Crawley Town",3,3
"2022-05-07",2021,"Stevenage Borough","Salford City",4,2
"2022-05-07",2021,"Walsall","Swindon Town",0,3
```

## Format Settings {#format-settings}

:::note
If setting [`input_format_with_names_use_header`](../../../operations/settings/settings-formats.md/#input_format_with_names_use_header) is set to `1`,
the columns from input data will be mapped to the columns from the table by their names, columns with unknown names will be skipped if setting [input_format_skip_unknown_fields](../../../operations/settings/settings-formats.md/#input_format_skip_unknown_fields) is set to `1`.
Otherwise, the first row will be skipped.
