## Description {#description}

Also prints two header rows with column names and types, similar to [TabSeparatedWithNamesAndTypes](../formats/TabSeparatedWithNamesAndTypes).

## Example Usage {#example-usage}

### Inserting Data {#inserting-data}

:::tip
Starting from [version](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/releases) 23.1, ClickHouse will automatically detect headers in CSV files when using the `CSV` format, so it is not necessary to use `CSVWithNames` or `CSVWithNamesAndTypes`.
:::

Using the following CSV file, named as `football_types.csv`:

```csv
date,season,home_team,away_team,home_team_goals,away_team_goals
Date,Int16,LowCardinality(String),LowCardinality(String),Int8,Int8
2022-04-30,2021,Sutton United,Bradford City,1,4
2022-04-30,2021,Swindon Town,Barrow,2,1
2022-04-30,2021,Tranmere Rovers,Oldham Athletic,2,0
2022-05-02,2021,Salford City,Mansfield Town,2,2

2022-05-07,2021,Stevenage Borough,Salford City,4,2
2022-05-07,2021,Walsall,Swindon Town,0,3
```

Create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE football
(
    `date` Date,
    `season` Int16,
    `home_team` LowCardinality(String),
    `away_team` LowCardinality(String),
    `home_team_goals` Int8,
    `away_team_goals` Int8
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (date, home_team);
```

Insert data using the `CSVWithNamesAndTypes` format:

```sql
INSERT INTO football FROM INFILE 'football_types.csv' FORMAT CSVWithNamesAndTypes;
```

### Reading Data {#reading-data}

Read data using the `CSVWithNamesAndTypes` format:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM football
FORMAT CSVWithNamesAndTypes
```

The output will be a CSV with a two header rows for column names and types:

```csv
"date","season","home_team","away_team","home_team_goals","away_team_goals"
"Date","Int16","LowCardinality(String)","LowCardinality(String)","Int8","Int8"

## Format Settings {#format-settings}

:::note
If setting [input_format_with_names_use_header](/operations/settings/settings-formats.md/#input_format_with_names_use_header) is set to `1`,
the columns from input data will be mapped to the columns from the table by their names, columns with unknown names will be skipped if setting [input_format_skip_unknown_fields](../../../operations/settings/settings-formats.md/#input_format_skip_unknown_fields) is set to `1`.
Otherwise, the first row will be skipped.
:::

:::note
If setting [input_format_with_types_use_header](../../../operations/settings/settings-formats.md/#input_format_with_types_use_header) is set to `1`,
the types from input data will be compared with the types of the corresponding columns from the table. Otherwise, the second row will be skipped.
