## Description

The `DWARF` format parses DWARF debug symbols from an ELF file (executable, library, or object file). 
It is similar to `dwarfdump`, but much faster (hundreds of MB/s) and supporting SQL. 
It produces one row for each Debug Information Entry (DIE) in the `.debug_info` section 
and includes "null"-entries that the DWARF encoding uses to terminate lists of children in the tree.

:::info
`.debug_info` consists of *units*, which correspond to compilation units: 
- Each unit is a tree of *DIE*s, with a `compile_unit` DIE as its root. 
- Each DIE has a *tag* and a list of *attributes*. 
- Each attribute has a *name* and a *value* (and also a *form*, which specifies how the value is encoded). 

The DIEs represent things from the source code, and their *tag* tells you what kind of thing it is. For example, there are:

- functions (tag = `subprogram`)
- classes/structs/enums (`class_type`/`structure_type`/`enumeration_type`)
- variables (`variable`)
- function arguments (`formal_parameter`).

The tree structure mirrors the corresponding source code. For example, a `class_type` DIE can contain `subprogram` DIEs representing methods of the class.
:::

The `DWARF` format outputs the following columns:

- `offset` - position of the DIE in the `.debug_info` section
- `size` - number of bytes in the encoded DIE (including attributes)
- `tag` - type of the DIE; the conventional "DW_TAG_" prefix is omitted
- `unit_name` - name of the compilation unit containing this DIE
- `unit_offset` - position of the compilation unit containing this DIE in the `.debug_info` section
- `ancestor_tags` - array of tags of the ancestors of the current DIE in the tree, in order from innermost to outermost
- `ancestor_offsets` - offsets of ancestors, parallel to `ancestor_tags`
- a few common attributes duplicated from the attributes array for convenience:
    - `name`
    - `linkage_name` - mangled fully qualified name; typically only functions have it (but not all functions)
    - `decl_file` - name of the source code file where this entity was declared
    - `decl_line` - line number in the source code where this entity was declared
- parallel arrays describing attributes:
    - `attr_name` - name of the attribute; the conventional "DW_AT_" prefix is omitted
    - `attr_form` - how the attribute is encoded and interpreted; the conventional DW_FORM_ prefix is omitted
    - `attr_int` - integer value of the attribute; 0 if the attribute doesn't have a numeric value
    - `attr_str` - string value of the attribute; empty if the attribute doesn't have a string value

## Example Usage

The `DWARF` format can be used to find compilation units that have the most function definitions (including template instantiations and functions from included header files):

```sql title="Query"
SELECT
    unit_name,
    count() AS c
FROM file('programs/clickhouse', DWARF)
WHERE tag = 'subprogram' AND NOT has(attr_name, 'declaration')
GROUP BY unit_name
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 3
```
```text title="Response"
