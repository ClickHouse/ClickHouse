# Drivers and Interfaces

ClickHouse provides three network interfaces (they can be optionally wrapped in TLS for additional security):

- [HTTP](http.md), which is documented and easy to use directly.
- [Native TCP](../interfaces/tcp.md), which has less overhead.
- [gRPC](grpc.md).

In most cases it is recommended to use an appropriate tool or library instead of interacting with those directly. The following are officially supported by ClickHouse:

- [Command-line client](../interfaces/cli.md)
- [JDBC driver](../interfaces/jdbc.md)
- [ODBC driver](../interfaces/odbc.md)
- [C++ client library](../interfaces/cpp.md)

ClickHouse server provides embedded visual interfaces for power users:

- Play UI: open `/play` in the browser;
- Advanced Dashboard: open `/dashboard` in the browser;

There are also a wide range of third-party libraries for working with ClickHouse:

- [Client libraries](../interfaces/third-party/client-libraries.md)
- [Integrations](../interfaces/third-party/integrations.md)
- [Visual interfaces](../interfaces/third-party/gui.md)
