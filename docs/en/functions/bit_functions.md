# Bit functions

Bit functions work for any pair of types from UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, Float32, or Float64.

The result type is an integer with bits equal to the maximum bits of its arguments. If at least one of the arguments is signed, the result is a signed number. If an argument is a floating-point number, it is cast to Int64.

## bitAnd(a, b)

## bitOr(a, b)

## bitXor(a, b)

## bitNot(a)

## bitShiftLeft(a, b)

## bitShiftRight(a, b)
