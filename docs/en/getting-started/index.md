# Tutorials and Example Datasets

We have a lot of resources for helping you get started and learn how ClickHouse works:

- If you need to get ClickHouse up and running, check out our [Quick Start](../quick-start.mdx)
- The [ClickHouse Tutorial](../tutorial.md) analyzes a dataset of New York City taxi rides

In addition, the sample datasets provide a great experience on working with ClickHouse,
learning important techniques and tricks, and seeing how to take advantage of the many powerful

https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-docs/blob/main/scripts/autogenerate-table-of-contents.sh
from the YAML front matter fields: slug, description, title.

If you've spotted an error, please edit the YML frontmatter of the pages themselves.
