# OnTime {#ontime}

This dataset can be obtained in two ways:

-   import from raw data
-   download of prepared partitions

## Import from Raw Data {#import-from-raw-data}

Downloading data:

``` bash
echo https://transtats.bts.gov/PREZIP/On_Time_Reporting_Carrier_On_Time_Performance_1987_present_{1987..2021}_{1..12}.zip | xargs -P10 wget --no-check-certificate --continue
```

Creating a table:

``` sql

    If you will run the queries described below, you have to use the full table name, `datasets.ontime`.

## Queries {#queries}

Q0.

``` sql
SELECT avg(c1)
FROM
(
    SELECT Year, Month, count(*) AS c1
    FROM ontime
    GROUP BY Year, Month
);
```

Q1. The number of flights per day from the year 2000 to 2008

``` sql
SELECT DayOfWeek, count(*) AS c
FROM ontime
WHERE Year>=2000 AND Year<=2008
GROUP BY DayOfWeek
ORDER BY c DESC;
```

Q2. The number of flights delayed by more than 10 minutes, grouped by the day of the week, for 2000-2008

``` sql
SELECT DayOfWeek, count(*) AS c
FROM ontime
WHERE DepDelay>10 AND Year>=2000 AND Year<=2008
GROUP BY DayOfWeek
ORDER BY c DESC;
```

Q3. The number of delays by the airport for 2000-2008

``` sql
SELECT Origin, count(*) AS c
FROM ontime
WHERE DepDelay>10 AND Year>=2000 AND Year<=2008
GROUP BY Origin
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Q4. The number of delays by carrier for 2007

``` sql
SELECT IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline AS Carrier, count(*)
FROM ontime
WHERE DepDelay>10 AND Year=2007
GROUP BY Carrier
ORDER BY count(*) DESC;
```

Q5. The percentage of delays by carrier for 2007

``` sql
SELECT Carrier, c, c2, c*100/c2 as c3
FROM
(
    SELECT
        IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline AS Carrier,
        count(*) AS c
    FROM ontime
    WHERE DepDelay>10
        AND Year=2007
    GROUP BY Carrier
) q
JOIN
(
    SELECT
        IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline AS Carrier,
        count(*) AS c2
    FROM ontime
    WHERE Year=2007
    GROUP BY Carrier
) qq USING Carrier
ORDER BY c3 DESC;
```

Better version of the same query:

``` sql
SELECT IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline AS Carrier, avg(DepDelay>10)*100 AS c3
FROM ontime
WHERE Year=2007
GROUP BY Carrier
ORDER BY c3 DESC
```

Q6. The previous request for a broader range of years, 2000-2008

``` sql
SELECT Carrier, c, c2, c*100/c2 as c3
FROM
(
    SELECT
        IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline AS Carrier,
        count(*) AS c
    FROM ontime
    WHERE DepDelay>10
        AND Year>=2000 AND Year<=2008
    GROUP BY Carrier
) q
JOIN
(
    SELECT
        IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline AS Carrier,
        count(*) AS c2
    FROM ontime
    WHERE Year>=2000 AND Year<=2008
    GROUP BY Carrier
) qq USING Carrier
ORDER BY c3 DESC;
```

Better version of the same query:

``` sql
SELECT IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline AS Carrier, avg(DepDelay>10)*100 AS c3
FROM ontime
WHERE Year>=2000 AND Year<=2008
GROUP BY Carrier
ORDER BY c3 DESC;
```

Q7. Percentage of flights delayed for more than 10 minutes, by year

``` sql
SELECT Year, c1/c2
FROM
(
    select
        Year,
        count(*)*100 as c1
    from ontime
    WHERE DepDelay>10
    GROUP BY Year
) q
JOIN
(
    select
        Year,
        count(*) as c2
    from ontime
    GROUP BY Year
) qq USING (Year)
ORDER BY Year;
```

Better version of the same query:

``` sql
SELECT Year, avg(DepDelay>10)*100
FROM ontime
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY Year;
```

Q8. The most popular destinations by the number of directly connected cities for various year ranges

``` sql
SELECT DestCityName, uniqExact(OriginCityName) AS u
FROM ontime
WHERE Year >= 2000 and Year <= 2010
GROUP BY DestCityName
ORDER BY u DESC LIMIT 10;
```

Q9.

``` sql
SELECT Year, count(*) AS c1
FROM ontime
GROUP BY Year;
```

Q10.

``` sql
SELECT
   min(Year), max(Year), IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline AS Carrier, count(*) AS cnt,
   sum(ArrDelayMinutes>30) AS flights_delayed,
   round(sum(ArrDelayMinutes>30)/count(*),2) AS rate
FROM ontime
WHERE
   DayOfWeek NOT IN (6,7) AND OriginState NOT IN ('AK', 'HI', 'PR', 'VI')
   AND DestState NOT IN ('AK', 'HI', 'PR', 'VI')
   AND FlightDate < '2010-01-01'
GROUP by Carrier
HAVING cnt>100000 and max(Year)>1990
ORDER by rate DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

Bonus:

``` sql
SELECT avg(cnt)
FROM
(
    SELECT Year,Month,count(*) AS cnt
    FROM ontime
    WHERE DepDel15=1
    GROUP BY Year,Month
);

SELECT avg(c1) FROM
(
    SELECT Year,Month,count(*) AS c1
    FROM ontime
    GROUP BY Year,Month
);

SELECT DestCityName, uniqExact(OriginCityName) AS u
FROM ontime
GROUP BY DestCityName
ORDER BY u DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT OriginCityName, DestCityName, count() AS c
FROM ontime
GROUP BY OriginCityName, DestCityName
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT OriginCityName, count() AS c
FROM ontime
GROUP BY OriginCityName
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
