# Writing Queries in ClickHouse using GitHub Data

This dataset contains all of the commits and changes for the ClickHouse repository. It can be generated using the native `git-import` tool distributed with ClickHouse.

The generated data provides a `tsv` file for each of the following tables:

- `commits` - commits with statistics.
- `file_changes` - files changed in every commit with the info about the change and statistics.
- `line_changes` - every changed line in every changed file in every commit with full info about the line and the information about the previous change of this line.

As of November 8th, 2022, each TSV is approximately the following size and number of rows:

- `commits` - 7.8M - 266,051 rows
- `file_changes` - 53M - 266,051 rows
- `line_changes` - 2.7G - 7,535,157 rows

# Generating the data

This is optional. We distribute the data freely - see [Downloading and inserting the data](#downloading-and-inserting-the-data).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ClickHouse/ClickHouse.git
cd ClickHouse
clickhouse git-import --skip-paths 'generated\.cpp|^(contrib|docs?|website|libs/(libcityhash|liblz4|libdivide|libvectorclass|libdouble-conversion|libcpuid|libzstd|libfarmhash|libmetrohash|libpoco|libwidechar_width))/' --skip-commits-with-messages '^Merge branch '
```

This will take around 3 minutes (as of November 8th 2022 on a MacBook Pro 2021) to complete for the ClickHouse repository.

A full list of available options can be obtained from the tools native help.

```bash
clickhouse git-import -h
```

This help also provides the DDL for each of the above tables e.g.

```
CREATE TABLE git.commits
(
    hash String,
    author LowCardinality(String),
    time DateTime,
    message String,
    files_added UInt32,
    files_deleted UInt32,
    files_renamed UInt32,
    files_modified UInt32,

    lines_deleted UInt32,
    hunks_added UInt32,
    hunks_removed UInt32,
    hunks_changed UInt32
) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY time;
```

**These queries should work on any repository. Feel free to explore and report your findings** Some guidelines with respect to execution times (as of November 2022):

- Linux - `~/clickhouse git-import` - 160 mins

# Queries

The tool suggests several queries via its help output. We have answered these in addition to some additional supplementary questions of interest. These queries are of approximately increasing complexity vs. the tool's arbitrary order.

This dataset is available in [play.clickhouse.com](https://sql.clickhouse.com?query_id=DCQPNPAIMAQXRLHYURLKVJ) in the `git_clickhouse` databases. We provide a link to this environment for all queries, adapting the database name as required. Note that play results may vary from the those presented here due to differences in time of data collection.

## History of a single file

The simplest of queries. Here we look at all commit messages for the `StorageReplicatedMergeTree.cpp`. Since these are likely more interesting, we sort by the most recent messages first.

[play](https://sql.clickhouse.com?query_id=COAZRFX2YFULDBXRQTCQ1S)

```sql

    time,
    substring(commit_hash, 1, 11) AS commit,
    change_type,

    lines_added,
    lines_deleted,
    commit_message
FROM git.file_changes

Note a more complex variant of this query exists where we find the [line-by-line commit history of a file](#line-by-line-commit-history-of-a-file) considering renames.

## Find the current active files

This is important for later analysis when we only want to consider the current files in the repository. We estimate this set as the files which haven't been renamed or deleted (and then re-added/re-named).

**Note there appears to have been a broken commit history in relation to files under the `dbms`, `libs`, `tests/testflows/` directories during their renames. We also thus exclude these.**

Note that this allows for files to be renamed and then re-renamed to their original values. First we aggregate `old_path` for a list of deleted files as a result of renaming. We union this with the last operation for every `path`. Finally, we filter this list to those where the final event is not a `Delete`.

[play](https://sql.clickhouse.com?query_id=1OXCKMOH2JVMSHD3NS2WW6)

```sql
SELECT uniq(path)
FROM
(
    SELECT path
    FROM
    (
        SELECT
            old_path AS path,
            max(time) AS last_time,

        GROUP BY path
    )
    GROUP BY path
    HAVING (argMax(change_type, last_time) != 2) AND NOT match(path, '(^dbms/)|(^libs/)|(^tests/testflows/)|(^programs/server/store/)') ORDER BY path

```

Note that we skipped import of several directories during import i.e.

`--skip-paths 'generated\.cpp|^(contrib|docs?|website|libs/(libcityhash|liblz4|libdivide|libvectorclass|libdouble-conversion|libcpuid|libzstd|libfarmhash|libmetrohash|libpoco|libwidechar_width))/'`

Applying this pattern to `git list-files`, reports 18155.

```bash
git ls-files | grep -v -E 'generated\.cpp|^(contrib|docs?|website|libs/(libcityhash|liblz4|libdivide|libvectorclass|libdouble-conversion|libcpuid|libzstd|libfarmhash|libmetrohash|libpoco|libwidechar_width))/' | wc -l
   18155
```

**Our current solution is therefore an estimate of the current files**

The difference here is caused by a few factors:

- A rename can occur alongside other modifications to the file. These are listed as separate events in file_changes but with the same time. The `argMax` function has no way of distinguishing these - it picks the first value. The natural ordering of the inserts (the only means of knowing the correct order) is not maintained across the union so modified events can be selected. For example, below the `src/Functions/geometryFromColumn.h` file has several modifications before being renamed to `src/Functions/geometryConverters.h`. Our current solution may pick a Modify event as the latest change causing `src/Functions/geometryFromColumn.h` to be retained.

These differences shouldn't meaningfully impact our analysis. **We welcome improved versions of this query**.

## History of subdirectory/file - number of lines, commits and contributors over time

This would produce a large query result that is unrealistic to show or visualize if unfiltered. We, therefore, allow a file or subdirectory to be filtered in the following example. Here we group by week using the `toStartOfWeek` function - adapt as required.

WHERE path LIKE 'src/Storages%'

Our core data structure, the Merge Tree, is obviously under constant evolution with a long history of edits!

## Distribution of contributors with respect to docs and code over the month

**During data capture the changes on the `docs/` folder have been filtered out due to a very commit dirty history. The results of this query are therefore not accurate.**

Do we write more docs at certain times of the month e.g., around release dates? We can use the `countIf` function to compute a simple ratio, visualizing the result using the `bar` function.

[play](https://sql.clickhouse.com?query_id=BA4RZUXUHNQBH9YK7F2T9J)

```sql
SELECT
    day,
    bar(docs_ratio * 1000, 0, 100, 100) AS bar
FROM
(
    SELECT
        day,
        countIf(file_extension IN ('h', 'cpp', 'sql')) AS code,
        countIf(file_extension = 'md') AS docs,
        docs / (code + docs) AS docs_ratio
    FROM git.line_changes
    WHERE (sign = 1) AND (file_extension IN ('h', 'cpp', 'sql', 'md'))
    GROUP BY dayOfMonth(time) AS day
)

Maybe a little more near the end of the month, but overall we keep a good even distribution. Again this is unreliable due to the filtering of the docs filter during data insertion.

## Authors with the most diverse impact

This makes sense because Alexey has been responsible for maintaining the Change log. But what if we use the base name of the file to identify his popular files - this allows for renames and should focus on code contributions.

This is maybe more reflective of his areas of interest.

## Largest files with lowest number of authors

For this, we first need to identify the largest files. Estimating this via a full file reconstruction, for every file, from the history of commits will be very expensive!

To estimate, assuming we restrict to current files, we sum line additions and subtract deletions. We can then compute a ratio of length to the number of authors.

There is some recency bias in this - newer files have fewer opportunities for commits. What about if we restrict to files at least 1 yr old?

A Sankey chart (SuperSet) allows this to be visualized nicely. Note we increase our `LIMIT BY` to 3, to get the top 3 code removers for each author, to improve the variety in the visual.

Alexey clearly likes removing other peoples code. Lets exclude him for a more balanced view of code removal.

## Who is the highest percentage contributor per day of week?

If we consider by just number of commits:

This is still a little simple and doesn't reflect people's work.

A better metric might be who is the top contributor each day as a fraction of the total work performed in the last year. Note that we treat the deletion and adding code equally.

## List files that were rewritten most number of times?


The simplest approach to this question might be to simply count the most number of line modifications per path (restricted to current files) e.g.:

```sql
WITH current_files AS
    (
        SELECT path
        FROM
        (
            SELECT
                old_path AS path,
                max(time) AS last_time,
                2 AS change_type
            FROM git.file_changes
            GROUP BY old_path
            UNION ALL
            SELECT
                path,
                max(time) AS last_time,
                argMax(change_type, time) AS change_type
            FROM git.file_changes
            GROUP BY path
        )
        GROUP BY path
        HAVING (argMax(change_type, last_time) != 2) AND (NOT match(path, '(^dbms/)|(^libs/)|(^tests/testflows/)|(^programs/server/store/)'))
        ORDER BY path ASC
    )
SELECT
    path,
    count() AS c
FROM git.line_changes
WHERE (file_extension IN ('h', 'cpp', 'sql')) AND (path IN (current_files))
GROUP BY path
ORDER BY c DESC

```

This doesn't capture the notion of a "re-write" however, where a large portion of the file changes in any commit. This requires a more complex query. If we consider a rewrite to be when over 50% of the file are deleted, and 50% added. You can adjust the query to your own interpretation of what constitutes this.

The query is limited to the current files only. We list all file changes by grouping by `path` and `commit_hash`, returning the number of lines added and removed. Using a window function, we estimate the file's total size at any moment in time by performing a cumulative sum and estimating the impact of any change on file size as `lines added - lines removed`. Using this statistic, we can calculate the percentage of the file that has been added or removed for each change. Finally, we count the number of file changes that constitute a rewrite per file i.e. `(percent_add >= 0.5) AND (percent_delete >= 0.5) AND current_size > 50`. Note we require files to be more than 50 lines to avoid early contributions to a file being counted as a rewrite. This also avoids a bias to very small files, which may be more likely to be rewritten.

## What weekday does the code have the highest chance to stay in the repository?

For this, we need to identify a line of code uniquely. We estimate this(as the same line may appear multiple times in a file) using the path and line contents.

We query for lines added, joining this with the lines removed - filtering to cases where the latter occurs more recently than the former. This gives us the deleted lines from which we can compute the time between these two events.

Finally, we aggregate across this dataset to compute the average number of days lines stay in the repository by the day of the week.

## Files sorted by average code age

This query uses the same principle as [What weekday does the code have the highest chance to stay in the repository](#what-weekday-does-the-code-have-the-highest-chance-to-stay-in-the-repository) - by aiming to uniquely identify a line of code using the path and line contents.
This allows us to identify the time between when a line was added and removed. We filter to current files and code only, however, and average the time for each file across lines.

## Who tends to write more tests / CPP code / comments?

There are a few ways we can address this question. Focusing on the code to test ratio, this query is relatively simple - count the number of contributions to folders containing `tests` and compute the ratio to total contributions.

Note we limit to users with more than 20 changes to focus on regular committers and avoid a bias to one-off contributions.

Ideally, however, we want to see how this changes in aggregate across all authors from the first day they start committing. Do they slowly reduce the number of comments they write?

To compute this, we first work out each author's comments ratio over time - similar to [Who tends to write more tests / CPP code / comments?](#who-tends-to-write-more-tests--cpp-code--comments). This is joined against each author's start date, allowing us to calculate the comment ratio by week offset.

After calculating the average by-week offset across all authors, we sample these results by selecting every 10th week.

Encouragingly, our comment % is pretty constant and doesn't degrade the longer authors contribute.

## What is the average time before code will be rewritten and the median (half-life of code decay)?

We can use the same principle as [List files that were rewritten most number of time or by most of authors](#list-files-that-were-rewritten-most-number-of-time-or-by-most-of-authors) to identify rewrites but consider all files. A window function is used to compute the time between rewrites for each file. From this, we can calculate an average and median across all files.

## Which authors code is the most sticky?

We define "sticky" as how long does an author's code stay before its rewritten. Similar to the previous question [What is the average time before code will be rewritten and the median (half-life of code decay)?](#what-is-the-average-time-before-code-will-be-rewritten-and-the-median-half-life-of-code-decay) - using the same metric for rewrites i.e. 50% additions and 50% deletions to the file. We compute the average rewrite time per author and only consider contributors with more than two files.

## Most consecutive days of commits by an author

This query first requires us to calculate the days when an author has committed. Using a window function, partitioning by author, we can compute the days between their commits. For each commit, if the time since the last commit was 1 day we mark it as consecutive (1) and 0 otherwise - storing this result in `consecutive_day`.

Our subsequent array functions compute each author's longest sequence of consecutive ones. First, the `groupArray` function is used to collate all `consecutive_day` values for an author. This array of 1s and 0s, is then split on 0 values into subarrays. Finally, we calculate the longest subarray.

## Line by line commit history of a file

Files can be renamed. When this occurs, we get a rename event, where the `path` column is set to the new path of the file and the `old_path` represents the previous location e.g.

This makes viewing the full history of a file challenging since we don't have a single value connecting all line or file changes.

To address this, we can use User Defined Functions (UDFs). These cannot, currently, be recursive, so to identify the history of a file we must define a series of UDFs which call each other explicitly.

This means we can only track renames to a maximum depth - the below example is 5 deep. It is unlikely a file will be renamed more times than this, so for now, this is sufficient.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION file_path_history AS (n) -> if(empty(n),  [], arrayConcat([n], file_path_history_01((SELECT if(empty(old_path), Null, old_path) FROM git.file_changes WHERE path = n AND (change_type = 'Rename' OR change_type = 'Add') LIMIT 1))));
CREATE FUNCTION file_path_history_01 AS (n) -> if(isNull(n), [], arrayConcat([n], file_path_history_02((SELECT if(empty(old_path), Null, old_path) FROM git.file_changes WHERE path = n AND (change_type = 'Rename' OR change_type = 'Add') LIMIT 1))));
CREATE FUNCTION file_path_history_02 AS (n) -> if(isNull(n), [], arrayConcat([n], file_path_history_03((SELECT if(empty(old_path), Null, old_path) FROM git.file_changes WHERE path = n AND (change_type = 'Rename' OR change_type = 'Add') LIMIT 1))));
CREATE FUNCTION file_path_history_03 AS (n) -> if(isNull(n), [], arrayConcat([n], file_path_history_04((SELECT if(empty(old_path), Null, old_path) FROM git.file_changes WHERE path = n AND (change_type = 'Rename' OR change_type = 'Add') LIMIT 1))));
CREATE FUNCTION file_path_history_04 AS (n) -> if(isNull(n), [], arrayConcat([n], file_path_history_05((SELECT if(empty(old_path), Null, old_path) FROM git.file_changes WHERE path = n AND (change_type = 'Rename' OR change_type = 'Add') LIMIT 1))));
CREATE FUNCTION file_path_history_05 AS (n) -> if(isNull(n), [], [n]);
```

By calling `file_path_history('src/Storages/StorageReplicatedMergeTree.cpp')` we recurse through the rename history, with each function calling the next level with the `old_path`. The results are combined using `arrayConcat`.

For example,

```sql
SELECT file_path_history('src/Storages/StorageReplicatedMergeTree.cpp') AS paths

┌─paths─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ['src/Storages/StorageReplicatedMergeTree.cpp','dbms/Storages/StorageReplicatedMergeTree.cpp','dbms/src/Storages/StorageReplicatedMergeTree.cpp'] │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1 row in set. Elapsed: 0.074 sec. Processed 344.06 thousand rows, 6.27 MB (4.65 million rows/s., 84.71 MB/s.)
```

We can use this capability to now assemble the commits for the entire history of a file. In this example, we show one commit for each of the `path` values.

```sql
SELECT
    time,
    substring(commit_hash, 1, 11) AS commit,
    change_type,
    author,
    path,
    commit_message
FROM git.file_changes
WHERE path IN file_path_history('src/Storages/StorageReplicatedMergeTree.cpp')
ORDER BY time DESC
LIMIT 1 BY path
FORMAT PrettyCompactMonoBlock

# Unsolved Questions

## Git blame

This is particularly difficult to get an exact result due to the inability to currently keep state in array functions. This will be possible with an `arrayFold` or `arrayReduce`, which allows state to be held on each iteration.

An approximate solution, sufficient for a high-level analysis, may look something like this:

```sql
SELECT
    line_number_new,
    argMax(author, time),
    argMax(line, time)
FROM git.line_changes
WHERE path IN file_path_history('src/Storages/StorageReplicatedMergeTree.cpp')
GROUP BY line_number_new
ORDER BY line_number_new ASC
LIMIT 20
