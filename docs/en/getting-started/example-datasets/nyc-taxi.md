# New York Taxi Data {#new-york-taxi-data}

This dataset can be obtained in two ways:

-   import from raw data
-   download of prepared partitions

## How to Import the Raw Data {#how-to-import-the-raw-data}

See https://github.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data and http://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-rides-redshift.html for the description of a dataset and instructions for downloading.

Downloading will result in about 227 GB of uncompressed data in CSV files. The download takes about an hour over a 1 Gbit connection (parallel downloading from s3.amazonaws.com recovers at least half of a 1 Gbit channel).
Some of the files might not download fully. Check the file sizes and re-download any that seem doubtful.

Some of the files might contain invalid rows. You can fix them as follows:

``` bash
sed -E '/(.*,){18,}/d' data/yellow_tripdata_2010-02.csv > data/yellow_tripdata_2010-02.csv_
sed -E '/(.*,){18,}/d' data/yellow_tripdata_2010-03.csv > data/yellow_tripdata_2010-03.csv_
mv data/yellow_tripdata_2010-02.csv_ data/yellow_tripdata_2010-02.csv
mv data/yellow_tripdata_2010-03.csv_ data/yellow_tripdata_2010-03.csv
```

Then the data must be pre-processed in PostgreSQL. This will create selections of points in the polygons (to match points on the map with the boroughs of New York City) and combine all the data into a single denormalized flat table by using a JOIN. To do this, you will need to install PostgreSQL with PostGIS support.

Be careful when running `initialize_database.sh` and manually re-check that all the tables were created correctly.

It takes about 20-30 minutes to process each month’s worth of data in PostgreSQL, for a total of about 48 hours.

You can check the number of downloaded rows as follows:

``` bash
$ time psql nyc-taxi-data -c "SELECT count(*) FROM trips;"
## Count
 1298979494
(1 row)

real    7m9.164s
```

(This is slightly more than 1.1 billion rows reported by Mark Litwintschik in a series of blog posts.)

The data in PostgreSQL uses 370 GB of space.

The data snapshot is created at a speed of about 50 MB per second. While creating the snapshot, PostgreSQL reads from the disk at a speed of about 28 MB per second.
This takes about 5 hours. The resulting TSV file is 590612904969 bytes.

It is needed for converting fields to more correct data types and, if possible, to eliminate NULLs.

``` bash
$ time clickhouse-client --query="INSERT INTO trips FORMAT TabSeparated" < trips.tsv

real    75m56.214s
```

Data is read at a speed of 112-140 Mb/second.
Loading data into a Log type table in one stream took 76 minutes.
The data in this table uses 142 GB.

(Importing data directly from Postgres is also possible using `COPY ... TO PROGRAM`.)

Unfortunately, all the fields associated with the weather (precipitation…average_wind_speed) were filled with NULL. Because of this, we will remove them from the final data set.

To start, we’ll create a table on a single server. Later we will make the table distributed.

Create and populate a summary table:

This takes 3030 seconds at a speed of about 428,000 rows per second.
To load it faster, you can create the table with the `Log` engine instead of `MergeTree`. In this case, the download works faster than 200 seconds.

The table uses 126 GB of disk space.

``` sql
SELECT formatReadableSize(sum(bytes)) FROM system.parts WHERE table = 'trips_mergetree' AND active
```

``` text
┌─formatReadableSize(sum(bytes))─┐
│ 126.18 GiB                     │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

Among other things, you can run the OPTIMIZE query on MergeTree. But it’s not required since everything will be fine without it.

Execution time is the best of three runs. But starting from the second run, queries read data from the file system cache. No further caching occurs: the data is read out and processed in each run.

```

On the source server:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE trips_mergetree_x3 AS trips_mergetree_third ENGINE = Distributed(perftest, default, trips_mergetree_third, rand())
```

The following query redistributes data:

``` sql
INSERT INTO trips_mergetree_x3 SELECT * FROM trips_mergetree
```

This takes 2454 seconds.

On three servers:

Q1: 0.212 seconds.
Q2: 0.438 seconds.
Q3: 0.733 seconds.
Q4: 1.241 seconds.

No surprises here, since the queries are scaled linearly.

We also have the results from a cluster of 140 servers:

Q1: 0.028 sec.
Q2: 0.043 sec.
Q3: 0.051 sec.
Q4: 0.072 sec.

In this case, the query processing time is determined above all by network latency.
We ran queries using a client located in a Yandex datacenter in Finland on a cluster in Russia, which added about 20 ms of latency.
