# Recipes Dataset

RecipeNLG dataset is available for download [here](https://recipenlg.cs.put.poznan.pl/dataset). It contains 2.2 million recipes. The size is slightly less than 1 GB.

## Download and Unpack the Dataset

1. Go to the download page [https://recipenlg.cs.put.poznan.pl/dataset](https://recipenlg.cs.put.poznan.pl/dataset).
1. Accept Terms and Conditions and download zip file.
1. Unpack the zip file with `unzip`. You will get the `full_dataset.csv` file.

## Create a Table

Run clickhouse-client and execute the following CREATE query:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE recipes
(
    title String,
    ingredients Array(String),
    directions Array(String),
    link String,
    source LowCardinality(String),
    NER Array(String)
) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY title;
```

## Insert the Data

Run the following command:

``` bash
clickhouse-client --query "
    INSERT INTO recipes
    SELECT
        title,
        JSONExtract(ingredients, 'Array(String)'),
        JSONExtract(directions, 'Array(String)'),
        link,
        source,
        JSONExtract(NER, 'Array(String)')
    FROM input('num UInt32, title String, ingredients String, directions String, link String, source LowCardinality(String), NER String')
    FORMAT CSVWithNames
" --input_format_with_names_use_header 0 --format_csv_allow_single_quote 0 --input_format_allow_errors_num 10 < full_dataset.csv
```

This is a showcase how to parse custom CSV, as it requires multiple tunes.

Explanation:
-   The dataset is in CSV format, but it requires some preprocessing on insertion; we use table function [input](../../sql-reference/table-functions/input.md) to perform preprocessing;
-   The structure of CSV file is specified in the argument of the table function `input`;
-   The field `num` (row number) is unneeded - we parse it from file and ignore;
-   We use `FORMAT CSVWithNames` but the header in CSV will be ignored (by command line parameter `--input_format_with_names_use_header 0`), because the header does not contain the name for the first field;
-   File is using only double quotes to enclose CSV strings; some strings are not enclosed in double quotes, and single quote must not be parsed as the string enclosing - that's why we also add the `--format_csv_allow_single_quote 0` parameter;
-   Some strings from CSV cannot parse, because they contain `\M/` sequence at the beginning of the value; the only value starting with backslash in CSV can be `\N` that is parsed as SQL NULL. We add `--input_format_allow_errors_num 10` parameter and up to ten malformed records can be skipped;
-   There are arrays for ingredients, directions and NER fields; these arrays are represented in unusual form: they are serialized into string as JSON and then placed in CSV - we parse them as String and then use [JSONExtract](../../sql-reference/functions/json-functions/) function to transform it to Array.

## Validate the Inserted Data

By checking the row count:

Query:

``` sql
SELECT count() FROM recipes;
```

Result:

``` text
┌─count()─┐
│ 2231141 │
└─────────┘
```

## Example Queries

### Top Components by the Number of Recipes:

In this example we learn how to use [arrayJoin](../../sql-reference/functions/array-join/) function to expand an array into a set of rows.

Query:

``` sql
SELECT
    arrayJoin(NER) AS k,
    count() AS c
FROM recipes
GROUP BY k
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 50
```

Result:
