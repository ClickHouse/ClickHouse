# Brown University Benchmark

`MgBench` is a new analytical benchmark for machine-generated log data, [Andrew Crotty](http://cs.brown.edu/people/acrotty/).

Download the data:
```
wget https://datasets.clickhouse.tech/mgbench{1..3}.csv.xz
```

Unpack the data:
```
xz -v -d mgbench{1..3}.csv.xz
```

Create tables:
```
CREATE DATABASE mgbench;

Insert data:

```
clickhouse-client --query "INSERT INTO mgbench.logs1 FORMAT CSVWithNames" < mgbench1.csv
clickhouse-client --query "INSERT INTO mgbench.logs2 FORMAT CSVWithNames" < mgbench2.csv
clickhouse-client --query "INSERT INTO mgbench.logs3 FORMAT CSVWithNames" < mgbench3.csv
