# Star Schema Benchmark (SSB, 2009)

The Star Schema Benchmark is roughly based on the [TPC-H](tpch.md)'s tables and queries but unlike TPC-H, it uses a star schema layout.
The bulk of the data sits in a gigantic fact table which is surrounded by multiple small dimension tables.
The queries joined the fact table with one or more dimension tables to apply filter criteria, e.g. `MONTH = 'JANUARY'`.

References:
- [Star Schema Benchmark](https://cs.umb.edu/~poneil/StarSchemaB.pdf) (O'Neil et. al), 2009
- [Variations of the Star Schema Benchmark to Test the Effects of Data Skew on Query Performance](https://doi.org/10.1145/2479871.2479927) (Rabl. et. al.), 2013

First, checkout the star schema benchmark repository and compile the data generator:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/vadimtk/ssb-dbgen.git
cd ssb-dbgen
make
```

Then, generate the data. Parameter `-s` specifies the scale factor. For example, with `-s 100`, 600 million rows are generated.

``` bash
./dbgen -s 1000 -T c
./dbgen -s 1000 -T l
./dbgen -s 1000 -T p
./dbgen -s 1000 -T s
./dbgen -s 1000 -T d
```

Now create tables in ClickHouse:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE customer
(
        C_CUSTKEY       UInt32,
        C_NAME          String,
        C_ADDRESS       String,

        C_NATION        LowCardinality(String),
        C_REGION        LowCardinality(String),
        C_PHONE         String,
        C_MKTSEGMENT    LowCardinality(String)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY (C_CUSTKEY);

CREATE TABLE lineorder

    LO_PARTKEY              UInt32,

    LO_COMMITDATE           Date,
    LO_SHIPMODE             LowCardinality(String)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree PARTITION BY toYear(LO_ORDERDATE) ORDER BY (LO_ORDERDATE, LO_ORDERKEY);

CREATE TABLE part
(
        P_PARTKEY       UInt32,
        P_NAME          String,
        P_MFGR          LowCardinality(String),
        P_CATEGORY      LowCardinality(String),
        P_BRAND         LowCardinality(String),

        P_TYPE          LowCardinality(String),
        P_SIZE          UInt8,
        P_CONTAINER     LowCardinality(String)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY P_PARTKEY;

CREATE TABLE supplier
(
        S_SUPPKEY       UInt32,
        S_NAME          String,
        S_ADDRESS       String,
        S_CITY          LowCardinality(String),
        S_NATION        LowCardinality(String),
        S_REGION        LowCardinality(String),
        S_PHONE         String
)
ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY S_SUPPKEY;

CREATE TABLE date
(
        D_DATEKEY            Date,
        D_DATE               FixedString(18),
        D_DAYOFWEEK          LowCardinality(String),
        D_MONTH              LowCardinality(String),
        D_YEAR               UInt16,
        D_YEARMONTHNUM       UInt32,
        D_YEARMONTH          LowCardinality(FixedString(7)),
        D_DAYNUMINWEEK       UInt8,
        D_DAYNUMINMONTH      UInt8,
        D_DAYNUMINYEAR       UInt16,
        D_MONTHNUMINYEAR     UInt8,

        D_HOLIDAYFL          UInt8,
        D_WEEKDAYFL          UInt8
)
ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY D_DATEKEY;
```

The data can be imported as follows:

``` bash
clickhouse-client --query "INSERT INTO customer FORMAT CSV" < customer.tbl
clickhouse-client --query "INSERT INTO part FORMAT CSV" < part.tbl
clickhouse-client --query "INSERT INTO supplier FORMAT CSV" < supplier.tbl
clickhouse-client --query "INSERT INTO lineorder FORMAT CSV" < lineorder.tbl
clickhouse-client --query "INSERT INTO date FORMAT CSV" < date.tbl
```

In many use cases of ClickHouse, multiple tables are converted into a single denormalized flat table.
This step is optional, below queries are listed in their original form and in a format rewritten for the denormalized table.

``` sql
SET max_memory_usage = 20000000000;

CREATE TABLE lineorder_flat
ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY (LO_ORDERDATE, LO_ORDERKEY)

```

The queries are generated by `./qgen -s <scaling_factor>`. Example queries for `s = 100`:
