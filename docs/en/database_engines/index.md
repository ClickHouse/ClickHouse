# Database Engines

Database engines allow you to work with tables.

By default, ClickHouse uses its native database engine, which provides configurable [table engines](../operations/table_engines/index.md) and an [SQL dialect](../query_language/syntax.md).

You can also use the following database engines:

- [MySQL](mysql.md)

- [Lazy](lazy.md)
