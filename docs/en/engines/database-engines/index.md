# Database Engines {#database-engines}

Database engines allow you to work with tables.

By default, ClickHouse uses its native database engine, which provides configurable [table engines](../../engines/table-engines/index.md) and an [SQL dialect](../../sql-reference/syntax.md).

You can also use the following database engines:

-   [MySQL](../../engines/database-engines/mysql.md)

-   [Lazy](../../engines/database-engines/lazy.md)
