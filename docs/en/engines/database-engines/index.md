# Database engines

Database engines allow you to work with tables. By default, ClickHouse uses the [Atomic](../../engines/database-engines/atomic.md) database engine, which provides configurable [table engines](../../engines/table-engines/index.md) and an [SQL dialect](../../sql-reference/syntax.md).

Here is a complete list of available database engines. Follow the links for more details:

| Page | Description |
|-----|-----|
| [Atomic](/engines/database-engines/atomic) | The `Atomic` engine supports non-blocking `DROP TABLE` and `RENAME TABLE` queries, and atomic `EXCHANGE TABLES`queries. The `Atomic` database engine is used by default. |
| [Lazy](/engines/database-engines/lazy) | Keeps tables in RAM only `expiration_time_in_seconds` seconds after last access. Can be used only with Log type tables. |
| [Replicated](/engines/database-engines/replicated) | The engine is based on the Atomic engine. It supports replication of metadata via DDL log being written to ZooKeeper and executed on all of the replicas for a given database. |
| [PostgreSQL](/engines/database-engines/postgresql) | Allows to connect to databases on a remote PostgreSQL server. |
| [MySQL](/engines/database-engines/mysql) | Allows connecting to databases on a remote MySQL server and perform `INSERT` and `SELECT` queries to exchange data between ClickHouse and MySQL. |
| [SQLite](/engines/database-engines/sqlite) | Allows to connect to SQLite databases and perform `INSERT` and `SELECT` queries to exchange data between ClickHouse and SQLite. |
| [MaterializedPostgreSQL](/engines/database-engines/materialized-postgresql) | Creates a ClickHouse database with tables from PostgreSQL database. |
| [Backup](/engines/database-engines/backup) | Allows to instantly attach table/database from backups in read-only mode. |
| [DataLakeCatalog](/engines/database-engines/datalakecatalog) | The DataLakeCatalog database engine enables you to connect ClickHouse to external data catalogs and query open table format data |
