# Lazy {#lazy}

Keeps tables in RAM only `expiration_time_in_seconds` seconds after last access. Can be used only with \*Log tables.

Itâ€™s optimized for storing many small \*Log tables, for which there is a long time interval between accesses.

## Creating a Database {#creating-a-database}

    CREATE DATABASE testlazy ENGINE = Lazy(expiration_time_in_seconds);
