# Full-text search using text indexes

<ExperimentalBadge/>
<CloudNotSupportedBadge/>

Text indexes in ClickHouse (also known as ["inverted indexes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index)) provide fast full-text capabilities on string data.
The index maps each token in the column to the rows which contain the token.
The tokens are generated by a process called tokenization.
For example, ClickHouse tokenizes the English sentence "All cat like mice." by default as ["All", "cat", "like", "mice"] (note that the trailing dot is ignored).
More advanced tokenizers are available, for example for log data.

## Creating a Text Index {#creating-a-text-index}

To create a text index, first enable the corresponding experimental setting:

```sql
SET allow_experimental_full_text_index = true;
```

A text index can be defined on a [String](/sql-reference/data-types/string.md) and [FixedString](/sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md) column using the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tab
(
    `key` UInt64,
    `str` String,
    INDEX text_idx(str) TYPE text(
                                -- Mandatory parameters:
                                tokenizer = 'default|ngram|split|no_op'
                                -- Optional parameters:
                                [, ngram_size = N]
                                [, separators = []]
                                [, dictionary_block_size = D]
                                [, max_cardinality_for_embedded_postings = M]
                                [, bloom_filter_false_positive_rate = R]
                            ) [GRANULARITY 64]
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY key
```

The `tokenizer` argument specifies the tokenizer:

- `default` splits strings along non-alphanumeric ASCII characters.
- `ngram` split strings into equally large n-grams.
- `split` split strings along certain user-defined separator strings.
- `no_op` performs no tokenization, i.e. every row value is a token.

To test how the tokenizers split the input string, you can use ClickHouse's [tokens](/sql-reference/functions/splitting-merging-functions.md/#tokens) function:

As an example,

```sql
SELECT tokens('abc def', 'ngram', 3) AS tokens;
```

returns

```result
+-tokens--------------------------+
| ['abc','bc ','c d',' de','def'] |
+---------------------------------+
```

If you chose the `ngram` tokenizer, you can set the ngram length using the (optional) parameter `ngram_size`.
If `ngram_size` is not specified, the default ngram size is 3.
The smallest and largest possible ngram size are 2 and 8.

If you chose the `split` tokenizer, you can set the separators using the (optional) parameter `separators`.
The parameter expects a list of strings, for example, `separators = [', ', '; ', '\n', '\\']`.
Note that each string can consist of multiple characters (`', '` in the example).
If parameter `split` is not specified, a single whitespace `[' ']` is used by default.

:::note
The `split` tokenizer applies the split separators left-to-right.
This can create ambiguities.
For example, the separator strings `['%21', '%']` will cause `%21abc` to be tokenized as `['abc']`, whereas switching both separators strings `['%', '%21']` will output `['21abc']`.
In the most cases, you want that matching prefers longer separators first.
This can generally be done by passing the separator strings in order of descending length.
If the separator strings happen to form a [prefix code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code), they can be passed in arbitrary order.
:::

Text indexes in ClickHouse are implemented as [secondary indexes](/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree.md/#skip-index-types).
However, unlike other skipping indexes, text indexes have a default index GRANULARITY of 64.
This value has been chosen empirically and it provides a good trade-off between speed and index size for most use cases.
Advanced users can specify a different index granularity (we do not recommend this).

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Advanced parameters</summary>

The default values of the following advanced parameters will work well in virtually all situations.
We do not recommend changing them.

Optional parameter `dictionary_block_size` (default: 128) specifies the size of dictionary blocks in rows.

Optional parameter `max_cardinality_for_embedded_postings` (default: 16) specifies the cardinality threshold below which posting lists should be embedded into dictionary blocks.

Optional parameter `bloom_filter_false_positive_rate` (default: 0.1) specifies the false-positive rate of the dictionary bloom filter.
</details>

Text indexes can be added to or removed from a column after the table has been created:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tab DROP INDEX text_idx;
ALTER TABLE tab ADD INDEX text_idx(s) TYPE text(tokenizer = 'default');
```

## Using a Text Index {#using-a-text-index}

Using a text index in SELECT queries is straightforward as common string search functions will leverage the index automatically.

### Supported functions {#functions-support}

The text index can be used if text functions are used in the `WHERE` clause of a SELECT query:

```sql
SELECT [...]
FROM [...]
WHERE string_search_function(column_with_text_index)
```

#### `=` and `!=` {#functions-example-equals-notequals}

`=` ([equals](/sql-reference/functions/comparison-functions.md/#equals)) and `!=` ([notEquals](/sql-reference/functions/comparison-functions.md/#notEquals) ) match the entire given search term.

Example:

```sql
SELECT * from tab WHERE str = 'Hello';
```

The text index supports `=` and `!=`, yet equality and inequality search only make sense with the `no_op` tokenizer (which causes the index to store entire row values).

#### `IN` and `NOT IN` {#functions-example-in-notin}

`IN` ([in](/sql-reference/functions/in-functions)) and `NOT IN` ([notIn](/sql-reference/functions/in-functions)) are similar to functions `equals` and `notEquals` but they match all (`IN`) or none (`NOT IN`) of the search terms.

Example:

```sql
SELECT * from tab WHERE str IN ('Hello', 'World');
```

The same restrictions as for `=` and `!=` apply, i.e. `IN` and `NOT IN` only make sense in conjunction with the `no_op` tokenizer.

#### `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE` and `match` {#functions-example-like-notlike-match}

:::note
These functions currently use the text index for filtering only if the index tokenizer is either `default` or `ngram`.
:::

In order to use `LIKE` [like](/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions.md/#like), `NOT LIKE` ([notLike](/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions.md/#notlike)), and the [match](/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions.md/#match) function with text indexes, ClickHouse must be able to extract complete tokens from the search term.

Example:

```sql
SELECT count() FROM tab WHERE comment LIKE 'support%';
```

`support` in the example could match `support`, `supports`, `supporting` etc.
This kind of query is a substring query and it cannot be sped up by a text index.

To leverage a text index for LIKE queries, the LIKE pattern must be rewritten in the following way:

```sql
SELECT count() FROM tab WHERE comment LIKE ' support %'; -- or `% support %`
```

The spaces left and right of `support` make sure that the term can be extracted as a token.

#### `startsWith` and `endsWith` {#functions-example-startswith-endswith}

Similar to `LIKE`, functions [startsWith](/sql-reference/functions/string-functions.md/#startswith) and [endsWith](/sql-reference/functions/string-functions.md/#endswith) can only use a text index, if complete tokens can be extracted from the search term.

Example:

```sql
SELECT count() FROM tab WHERE startsWith(comment, 'clickhouse support');
```

In the example, only `clickhouse` is considered a token.
`support` is no token because it can match `support`, `supports`, `supporting` etc.

To find all rows that start with `clickhouse supports`, please end the search pattern with a trailing space:

```sql
startsWith(comment, 'clickhouse supports ')`
```

Similarly, `endsWith` should be used with a leading space:

```sql
SELECT count() FROM tab WHERE endsWith(comment, ' olap engine');
```

#### `hasToken` and `hasTokenOrNull` {#functions-example-hastoken-hastokenornull}

Functions [hasToken](/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions.md/#hastoken) and [hasTokenOrNull](/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions.md/#hastokenornull) match against a single given token.

Unlike the previously mentioned functions, they do not tokenize the search term (they assume the input is a single token).

Example:

```sql
SELECT count() FROM tab WHERE hasToken(comment, 'clickhouse');
```

Functions `hasToken` and `hasTokenOrNull` are the most performant functions to use with the `text` index.

#### `searchAny` and `searchAll` {#functions-example-searchany-searchall}

Functions [searchAny](/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions.md/#searchany) and [searchAll](/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions.md/#searchall) match against one or all of the given tokens.

Like `hasToken`, no tokenization of the search terms takes place.

Example:

```sql
SELECT count() FROM tab WHERE searchAny(comment, ['clickhouse', 'olap']);

SELECT count() FROM tab WHERE searchAll(comment, ['clickhouse', 'olap']);
```

## Implementation {#implementation}

### Index layout {#index-layout}

Each text index consists of two (abstract) data structures:
- a dictionary which maps each token to a postings list, and
- a set of postings lists, each representing a set of row numbers.

Since a text index is a skip index, these data structures exist logically per index granule.

During index creation, three files are created (per part):

**Dictionary blocks file (.dct)**

The tokens in an index granule are sorted and stored in dictionary blocks of 128 tokens each (the block size is configurable by parameter `dictionary_block_size`).
A dictionary blocks file (.dct) consists all the dictionary blocks of all index granules in a part.

**Index granules file (.idx)**

The index granules file contains for each dictionary block the block's first token, its relative offset in the dictionary blocks file, and a bloom filter for all tokens in the block.
This sparse index structure is similar to ClickHouse's [sparse primary key index](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/best-practices/sparse-primary-indexes)).
The bloom filter allows to skip dictionary blocks early if the searched token is not contained in a dictionary block.

**Postings lists file (.pst)**

The posting lists for all tokens are laid out sequentially in the postings list file.
To save space while still allowing fast intersection and union operations, the posting lists are stored as [roaring bitmaps](https://roaringbitmap.org/).
If the cardinality of a posting list is less than 16 (configurable by parameter `max_cardinality_for_embedded_postings`), it is embedded into the dictionary.

### Direct read {#direct-read}

Certain types of text queries can be sped up significantly by an optimization called "direct read".
More specifically, if the SELECT query does _not_ project from the text column, the optimization can be applied.

Example:

```sql
SELECT column_a, column_b, ... -- not: column_with_text_index
FROM [...]
WHERE string_search_function(column_with_text_index)
```

#### Supported functions {#supported-functions}

## Example: Hackernews dataset {#hacker-news-dataset}

Let's look at the performance improvements of text indexes on a large dataset with lots of text.
We will use 28.7M rows of comments on the popular Hacker News website. Here is the table without an text index:

```sql
CREATE TABLE hackernews (
    id UInt64,
    deleted UInt8,
    type String,
    author String,
    timestamp DateTime,
    comment String,
    dead UInt8,
    parent UInt64,
    poll UInt64,
    children Array(UInt32),
    url String,
    score UInt32,
    title String,
    parts Array(UInt32),
    descendants UInt32
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (type, author);
```

The 28.7M rows are in a Parquet file in S3 - let's insert them into the `hackernews` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO hackernews
    SELECT * FROM s3Cluster(
        'default',
        'https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hackernews/hacknernews.parquet',
        'Parquet',
        '
    id UInt64,
    deleted UInt8,
    type String,
    by String,
    time DateTime,
    text String,
    dead UInt8,
    parent UInt64,
    poll UInt64,
    kids Array(UInt32),
    url String,
    score UInt32,
    title String,
    parts Array(UInt32),
    descendants UInt32');
```

Consider the following simple search for the term `ClickHouse` (and its varied upper and lower cases) in the `comment` column:

```sql
SELECT count()
FROM hackernews
WHERE hasToken(lower(comment), 'clickhouse');
```

Notice it takes 3 seconds to execute the query:

```response
┌─count()─┐
│    1145 │
└─────────┘

1 row in set. Elapsed: 3.001 sec. Processed 28.74 million rows, 9.75 GB (9.58 million rows/s., 3.25 GB/s.)
```

We will use `ALTER TABLE` and add an text index on the lowercase of the `comment` column, then materialize it (which can take a while - wait for it to materialize):

```sql
ALTER TABLE hackernews
     ADD INDEX comment_lowercase(lower(comment)) TYPE text;

ALTER TABLE hackernews MATERIALIZE INDEX comment_lowercase;
```

We run the same query...

```sql
SELECT count()
FROM hackernews
WHERE hasToken(lower(comment), 'clickhouse')
```

...and notice the query executes 4x faster:

```response
┌─count()─┐
│    1145 │
└─────────┘

1 row in set. Elapsed: 0.747 sec. Processed 4.49 million rows, 1.77 GB (6.01 million rows/s., 2.37 GB/s.)
```

We can also search for one or all of multiple terms, i.e., disjunctions or conjunctions:

```sql
-- multiple OR'ed terms
SELECT count(*)
FROM hackernews
WHERE hasToken(lower(comment), 'avx') OR hasToken(lower(comment), 'sve');

-- multiple AND'ed terms
SELECT count(*)
FROM hackernews
WHERE hasToken(lower(comment), 'avx') AND hasToken(lower(comment), 'sve');
```
