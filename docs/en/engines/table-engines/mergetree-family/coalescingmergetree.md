# CoalescingMergeTree

The engine inherits from [MergeTree](/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/versionedcollapsingmergetree). The difference is that when merging data parts for `CoalescingMergeTree` tables ClickHouse replaces all the rows with the same primary key (or more accurately, with the same [sorting key](../../../engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree.md)) with one row which contains the latest non-null values of each column. If the sorting key is composed in a way that a single key value corresponds to large number of rows, this significantly reduces storage volume and speeds up data selection.

We recommend using the engine together with `MergeTree`. Store complete data in `MergeTree` table, and use `CoalescingMergeTree` for aggregated data storing, for example, when preparing reports. Such an approach will prevent you from losing valuable data due to an incorrectly composed primary key.

## Creating a Table {#creating-a-table}

```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db.]table_name [ON CLUSTER cluster]
(
    name1 [type1] [DEFAULT|MATERIALIZED|ALIAS expr1],
    name2 [type2] [DEFAULT|MATERIALIZED|ALIAS expr2],
    ...
) ENGINE = CoalescingMergeTree([columns])
[PARTITION BY expr]
[ORDER BY expr]
[SAMPLE BY expr]
[SETTINGS name=value, ...]
```

For a description of request parameters, see [request description](../../../sql-reference/statements/create/table.md).

### Parameters of CoalescingMergeTree {#parameters-of-coalescingmergetree}

#### columns {#columns}

`columns` - a tuple with the names of columns where values will be united. Optional parameter.
    The columns must be of a numeric type and must not be in the partition or sorting key.

 If `columns` is not specified, ClickHouse unites the values in all columns that are not in the sorting key.

### Query clauses {#query-clauses}

When creating a `CoalescingMergeTree` table the same [clauses](../../../engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree.md) are required, as when creating a `MergeTree` table.

<summary>Deprecated Method for Creating a Table</summary>

:::note
Do not use this method in new projects and, if possible, switch the old projects to the method described above.
:::

```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db.]table_name [ON CLUSTER cluster]
(
    name1 [type1] [DEFAULT|MATERIALIZED|ALIAS expr1],
    name2 [type2] [DEFAULT|MATERIALIZED|ALIAS expr2],
    ...
) ENGINE [=] CoalescingMergeTree(date-column [, sampling_expression], (primary, key), index_granularity, [columns])
```

All of the parameters excepting `columns` have the same meaning as in `MergeTree`.

- `columns` — tuple with names of columns values of which will be summed. Optional parameter. For a description, see the text above.

</details>

## Usage Example {#usage-example}

Consider the following table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_table
(
    key UInt32,
    value UInt32
)
ENGINE = CoalescingMergeTree()
ORDER BY key
```

Insert data to it:

```sql
INSERT INTO test_table Values(1,NULL),(1,2),(2,1)
```

The result will looks like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM test_table;
```

```text
┌─key─┬─value─┐
│   2 │     1 │
│   1 │     2 │
└─────┴───────┘
```

ClickHouse may unite all the rows not completely ([see below](#data-processing)), so we use an aggregate function `last_value` and `GROUP BY` clause in the query.

```sql
SELECT key, last_value(value) FROM test_table GROUP BY key
```

```text
┌─key─┬─last_value(value)─┐
│   2 │                 1 │
│   1 │                 2 │
└─────┴───────────────────┘
```

## Data Processing {#data-processing}

When data are inserted into a table, they are saved as-is. ClickHouse merges the inserted parts of data periodically and this is when rows with the same primary key are summed and replaced with one for each resulting part of data.

ClickHouse can merge the data parts so that different resulting parts of data can consist rows with the same primary key, i.e. the union will be incomplete. Therefore (`SELECT`) an aggregate function [last_value()](/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference/last_value) and `GROUP BY` clause should be used in a query as described in the example above.
