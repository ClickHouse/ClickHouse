# Special Table Engines

There are three main categories of table engines:

-   [MergeTree engine family](../../../engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/index.md) for main production use.
-   [Log engine family](../../../engines/table-engines/log-family/index.md) for small temporary data.
-   [Table engines for integrations](../../../engines/table-engines/integrations/index.md).

The remaining engines are unique in their purpose and are not grouped into families yet, thus they are placed in this “special” category.
