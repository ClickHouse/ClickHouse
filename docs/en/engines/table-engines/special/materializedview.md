# MaterializedView Table Engine

Used for implementing materialized views (for more information, see [CREATE VIEW](../../../sql-reference/statements/create/view.md#materialized)). For storing data, it uses a different engine that was specified when creating the view. When reading from a table, it just uses that engine.
