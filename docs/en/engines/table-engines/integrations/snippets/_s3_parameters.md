| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `path` | Bucket url with path to file. Supports following wildcards in readonly mode: `*`, `**`, `?`, `{abc,def}` and `{N..M}` where `N`, `M` — numbers, `'abc'`, `'def'` — strings. For more information see [below](#wildcards-in-path). |
| `NOSIGN` | If this keyword is provided in place of credentials, all the requests will not be signed. |
| `format` | The [format](/sql-reference/formats#formats-overview) of the file. |
| `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key` | Long-term credentials for the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account user. You can use these to authenticate your requests. Parameter is optional. If credentials are not specified, they are used from the configuration file. For more information see [Using S3 for Data Storage](../mergetree-family/mergetree.md#table_engine-mergetree-s3). |
| `compression` | Compression type. Supported values: `none`, `gzip/gz`, `brotli/br`, `xz/LZMA`, `zstd/zst`. Parameter is optional. By default, it will auto-detect compression by file extension. |
| `partition_strategy` | Options: `WILDCARD` or `HIVE`. `WILDCARD` requires a `{_partition_id}` in the path, which is replaced with the partition key. `HIVE` does not allow wildcards, assumes the path is the table root, and generates Hive-style partitioned directories with Snowflake IDs as filenames and the file format as the extension. Defaults to `WILDCARD` |
| `partition_columns_in_data_file` | Only used with `HIVE` partition strategy. Tells ClickHouse whether to expect partition columns to be written in the data file. Defaults to `false`. |
| `storage_class_name` | Options: `STANDARD` or `INTELLIGENT_TIERING`, allow to specify [AWS S3 Intelligent Tiering](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/intelligent-tiering/). |
