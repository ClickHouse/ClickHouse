# What Does "ClickHouse" Mean?

It's a combination of "**Click**stream" and "Data ware**house**". It comes from the original use case at Yandex.Metrica, where ClickHouse was supposed to keep records of all clicks by people from all over the Internet and it still does the job. You can read more about this use case on [ClickHouse history](../../introduction/history.md) page.

!!! info "Fun fact"
    Many years after ClickHouse got its name, this approach of combining two words that are meaningful on their own has been highlighted as the best way to name a database in a [research by Andy Pavlo](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2020/03/on-naming-a-database-management-system.html), an Associate Professor of Databases at Carnegie Mellon University. ClickHouse shared his "best database name of all time" award with Postgres.
