# query_log

Contains information about executed queries, for example, start time, duration of processing, error messages.

:::note
This table does not contain the ingested data for `INSERT` queries.
:::

You can change settings of queries logging in the [query_log](../../operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings.md#server_configuration_parameters-query-log) section of the server configuration.

You can disable queries logging by setting [log_queries = 0](../../operations/settings/settings.md#settings-log-queries). We do not recommend to turn off logging because information in this table is important for solving issues.

The flushing period of data is set in `flush_interval_milliseconds` parameter of the [query_log](../../operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings.md#server_configuration_parameters-query-log) server settings section. To force flushing, use the [SYSTEM FLUSH LOGS](../../sql-reference/statements/system.md#query_language-system-flush_logs) query.

ClickHouse does not delete data from the table automatically. See [Introduction](../../operations/system-tables/index.md#system-tables-introduction) for more details.

The `system.query_log` table registers two kinds of queries:

1.  Initial queries that were run directly by the client.
2.  Child queries that were initiated by other queries (for distributed query execution). For these types of queries, information about the parent queries is shown in the `initial_*` columns.

Each query creates one or two rows in the `query_log` table, depending on the status (see the `type` column) of the query:

1.  If the query execution was successful, two rows with the `QueryStart` and `QueryFinish` types are created.
2.  If an error occurred during query processing, two events with the `QueryStart` and `ExceptionWhileProcessing` types are created.
3.  If an error occurred before launching the query, a single event with the `ExceptionBeforeStart` type is created.

You can use the [log_queries_probability](../../operations/settings/settings.md#log-queries-probability) setting to reduce the number of queries, registered in the `query_log` table.

You can use the [log_formatted_queries](../../operations/settings/settings.md#settings-log-formatted-queries) setting to log formatted queries to the `formatted_query` column.

Columns:

- `type` ([Enum8](../../sql-reference/data-types/enum.md)) — Type of an event that occurred when executing the query. Values:
    - `'QueryStart' = 1` — Successful start of query execution.
    - `'QueryFinish' = 2` — Successful end of query execution.
    - `'ExceptionBeforeStart' = 3` — Exception before the start of query execution.
    - `'ExceptionWhileProcessing' = 4` — Exception during the query execution.
- `event_date` ([Date](../../sql-reference/data-types/date.md)) — Query starting date.
