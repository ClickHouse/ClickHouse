### LoadAverage*N* {#loadaveragen}

The whole system load, averaged with exponential smoothing over 1 minute. The load represents the number of threads across all the processes (the scheduling entities of the OS kernel), that are currently running by CPU or waiting for IO, or ready to run but not being scheduled at this point of time. This number includes all the processes, not only clickhouse-server. The number can be greater than the number of CPU cores, if the system is overloaded, and many processes are ready to run but waiting for CPU or IO.

### MMapCacheCells {#mmapcachecells}

### MemoryDataAndStack {#memorydataandstack}

The amount of virtual memory mapped for the use of stack and for the allocated memory, in bytes. It is unspecified whether it includes the per-thread stacks and most of the allocated memory, that is allocated with the 'mmap' system call. This metric exists only for completeness reasons. I recommend to use the `MemoryResident` metric for monitoring.

### MemoryResidentMax {#memoryresidentmax}

### MemoryResident {#memoryresident}

The amount of physical memory used by the server process, in bytes.

### MemoryShared {#memoryshared}

The amount of memory used by the server process, that is also shared by another processes, in bytes. ClickHouse does not use shared memory, but some memory can be labeled by OS as shared for its own reasons. This metric does not make a lot of sense to watch, and it exists only for completeness reasons.

### MemoryVirtual {#memoryvirtual}

The size of the virtual address space allocated by the server process, in bytes. The size of the virtual address space is usually much greater than the physical memory consumption, and should not be used as an estimate for the memory consumption. The large values of this metric are totally normal, and makes only technical sense.

The amount of memory used by the OS page cache, in bytes. Typically, almost all available memory is used by the OS page cache - high values of this metric are normal and expected. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just clickhouse-server.

### OSMemoryFreePlusCached {#osmemoryfreepluscached}

The amount of free memory plus OS page cache memory on the host system, in bytes. This memory is available to be used by programs. The value should be very similar to `OSMemoryAvailable`. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just clickhouse-server.

### OSMemoryFreeWithoutCached {#osmemoryfreewithoutcached}

The amount of free memory on the host system, in bytes. This does not include the memory used by the OS page cache memory, in bytes. The page cache memory is also available for usage by programs, so the value of this metric can be confusing. See the `OSMemoryAvailable` metric instead. For convenience, we also provide the `OSMemoryFreePlusCached` metric, that should be somewhat similar to OSMemoryAvailable. See also https://www.linuxatemyram.com/.
