### FilesystemCacheFiles

Total number of cached file segments in the `cache` virtual filesystem. This cache is hold on disk.

### FilesystemLogsPathAvailableBytes

### FilesystemLogsPathAvailableINodes

The number of available inodes on the volume where ClickHouse logs path is mounted.

### FilesystemLogsPathTotalBytes

### FilesystemMainPathAvailableINodes

The number of available inodes on the volume where the main ClickHouse path is mounted. If it is close to zero, it indicates a misconfiguration, and you will get 'no space left on device' even when the disk is not full.

### FilesystemMainPathTotalBytes

The size of the volume where the main ClickHouse path is mounted, in bytes.

### FilesystemMainPathTotalINodes

The total number of inodes on the volume where the main ClickHouse path is mounted. If it is less than 25 million, it indicates a misconfiguration.

### HTTPThreads

Number of threads in the server of the HTTP interface (without TLS).

### InterserverThreads

Number of threads in the server of the replicas communication protocol (without TLS).

### Jitter

The difference in time the thread for calculation of the asynchronous metrics was scheduled to wake up and the time it was in fact, woken up. A proxy-indicator of overall system latency and responsiveness.

### LoadAverage_*N*

The whole system load, averaged with exponential smoothing over 1 minute. The load represents the number of threads across all the processes (the scheduling entities of the OS kernel), that are currently running by CPU or waiting for IO, or ready to run but not being scheduled at this point of time. This number includes all the processes, not only clickhouse-server. The number can be greater than the number of CPU cores, if the system is overloaded, and many processes are ready to run but waiting for CPU or IO.

### MMapCacheCells

The number of files opened with `mmap` (mapped in memory). This is used for queries with the setting `local_filesystem_read_method` set to  `mmap`. The files opened with `mmap` are kept in the cache to avoid costly TLB flushes.

### MarkCacheBytes

Total size of mark cache in bytes

### MarkCacheFiles

Total number of mark files cached in the mark cache

### MaxPartCountForPartition

Maximum number of parts per partition across all partitions of all tables of MergeTree family. Values larger than 300 indicates misconfiguration, overload, or massive data loading.

### MemoryCode

The amount of virtual memory mapped for the pages of machine code of the server process, in bytes.

### MemoryDataAndStack

The amount of virtual memory mapped for the use of stack and for the allocated memory, in bytes. It is unspecified whether it includes the per-thread stacks and most of the allocated memory, that is allocated with the 'mmap' system call. This metric exists only for completeness reasons. I recommend to use the `MemoryResident` metric for monitoring.

### MemoryResident

The amount of physical memory used by the server process, in bytes.

### MemoryShared

The amount of memory used by the server process, that is also shared by another processes, in bytes. ClickHouse does not use shared memory, but some memory can be labeled by OS as shared for its own reasons. This metric does not make a lot of sense to watch, and it exists only for completeness reasons.

### MemoryVirtual

The size of the virtual address space allocated by the server process, in bytes. The size of the virtual address space is usually much greater than the physical memory consumption, and should not be used as an estimate for the memory consumption. The large values of this metric are totally normal, and makes only technical sense.

### MySQLThreads

Number of threads in the server of the MySQL compatibility protocol.

### OSIdleTime

This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just clickhouse-server. This does not include the time when the CPU was under-utilized due to the reasons internal to the CPU (memory loads, pipeline stalls, branch mispredictions, running another SMT core).

### OSMemoryCached

The amount of memory used by the OS page cache, in bytes. Typically, almost all available memory is used by the OS page cache - high values of this metric are normal and expected. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just clickhouse-server.

### OSMemoryFreePlusCached

The amount of free memory plus OS page cache memory on the host system, in bytes. This memory is available to be used by programs. The value should be very similar to `OSMemoryAvailable`. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just clickhouse-server.

### OSMemoryFreeWithoutCached

The amount of free memory on the host system, in bytes. This does not include the memory used by the OS page cache memory, in bytes. The page cache memory is also available for usage by programs, so the value of this metric can be confusing. See the `OSMemoryAvailable` metric instead. For convenience we also provide the `OSMemoryFreePlusCached` metric, that should be somewhat similar to OSMemoryAvailable. See also https://www.linuxatemyram.com/. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just clickhouse-server.

### OSSoftIrqTime

The ratio of time spent for running software interrupt requests on the CPU. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just clickhouse-server. A high number of this metric may indicate inefficient software running on the system. The value for a single CPU core will be in the interval [0..1]. The value for all CPU cores is calculated as a sum across them [0..num cores].

### OSSoftIrqTimeCPU_*N*

The ratio of time spent for running software interrupt requests on the CPU. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just clickhouse-server. A high number of this metric may indicate inefficient software running on the system. The value for a single CPU core will be in the interval [0..1]. The value for all CPU cores is calculated as a sum across them [0..num cores].

### OSSoftIrqTimeNormalized

The value is similar to `OSSoftIrqTime` but divided to the number of CPU cores to be measured in the [0..1] interval regardless of the number of cores. This allows you to average the values of this metric across multiple servers in a cluster even if the number of cores is non-uniform, and still get the average resource utilization metric.

### OSStealTime

The ratio of time spent in other operating systems by the CPU when running in a virtualized environment. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just clickhouse-server. Not every virtualized environments present this metric, and most of them don't. The value for a single CPU core will be in the interval [0..1]. The value for all CPU cores is calculated as a sum across them [0..num cores].

### OSSystemTime

The ratio of time the CPU core was running OS kernel (system) code. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just clickhouse-server.

### OSThreadsTotal

The total number of threads, as the OS kernel scheduler seeing it.

### OSUptime

The uptime of the host server (the machine where ClickHouse is running), in seconds.

### OSUserTime

The ratio of time the CPU core was running userspace code. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just clickhouse-server. This includes also the time when the CPU was under-utilized due to the reasons internal to the CPU (memory loads, pipeline stalls, branch mispredictions, running another SMT core). The value for a single CPU core will be in the interval [0..1]. The value for all CPU cores is calculated as a sum across them [0..num cores].

### OSUserTimeCPU_*N*

Total size of the query cache cache in bytes.

### QueryCacheEntries

Total number of entries in the query cache.

### ReplicasMaxAbsoluteDelay

Maximum difference in seconds between the most fresh replicated part and the most fresh data part still to be replicated, across Replicated tables. A very high value indicates a replica with no data.

### ReplicasMaxInsertsInQueue

Total amount of rows (records) stored in all tables of MergeTree family.

### UncompressedCacheBytes

Total size of uncompressed cache in bytes. Uncompressed cache does not usually improve the performance and should be mostly avoided.
