# latency_log

<SystemTableCloud/>

Contains history of all latency buckets, periodically flushed to disk.

Columns:
- `hostname` ([LowCardinality(String)](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md)) — Hostname of the server executing the query.
- `event_date` ([Date](../../sql-reference/data-types/date.md)) — Event date.
- `event_time` ([DateTime](../../sql-reference/data-types/datetime.md)) — Event time.
- `event_time_microseconds` ([DateTime64](../../sql-reference/data-types/datetime64.md)) — Event time with microseconds resolution.

**Example**

``` sql
SELECT * FROM system.latency_log LIMIT 1 FORMAT Vertical;
```
