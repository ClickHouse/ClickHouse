<SystemTableCloud/>

Contains metrics which can be calculated instantly, or have a current value. For example, the number of simultaneously processed queries or the current replica delay. This table is always up to date.

Columns:

- `metric` ([String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md)) — Metric name.
- `value` ([Int64](../../sql-reference/data-types/int-uint.md)) — Metric value.
- `description` ([String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md)) — Metric description.
- `name` ([String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md)) — Alias for `metric`.

You can find all supported metrics in source file [src/Common/CurrentMetrics.cpp](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/src/Common/CurrentMetrics.cpp).

**Example**

``` sql
SELECT * FROM system.metrics LIMIT 10
```
