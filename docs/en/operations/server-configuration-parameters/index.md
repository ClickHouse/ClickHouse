# Server Configuration Parameters 

This section contains descriptions of server settings that cannot be changed at the session or query level.

These settings are stored in the `config.xml` file on the ClickHouse server.

Other settings are described in the “[Settings](../../operations/settings/index.md#session-settings-intro)” section.

Before studying the settings, read the [Configuration files](../../operations/configuration-files.md#configuration_files) section and note the use of substitutions (the `incl` and `optional` attributes).
