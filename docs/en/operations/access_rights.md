# Access Control and Account Management {#access-control}

ClickHouse supports access control management based on [RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) approach.

ClickHouse access entities:
- [User account](#user-account-management)
- [Role](#role-management)
- [Row Policy](#row-policy-management)
- [Settings Profile](#settings-profiles-management)
- [Quota](#quotas-management)

You can configure access entities using:

- SQL-driven workflow.

    You need to [enable](#enabling-access-control) this functionality. We recommend using this workflow instead of the configuration files approach.

- Server [configuration files](configuration_files.md) `users.xml` and `config.xml`.

!!! info "Note"
    Don't combine both methods of access control management, or it may cause exceptions.


## Usage {#access-control-usage}

By default, the ClickHouse server provides the user account `default` which is not allowed using SQL-driven access control and account management but have all the rights and permissions. The `default` user account is used in any cases when the username is not defined, for example, at login from client or in distributed queries. In distributed query processing a default user account is used, if the configuration of the server or cluster doesnâ€™t specify the [user and password](../engines/table_engines/special/distributed.md) properties.

If you just start using ClickHouse, you can use the following scenario:

1. [Enable](#enabling-access-control) SQL-driven access control and account management for the `default` user.
2. Login under the `default` user account and create all the required users. Don't forget to create an administrator account (`GRANT ALL ON *.* WITH GRANT OPTION TO admin_user_account`).
3. Restrict permissions for the `default` user and disable SQL-driven access control and account management for it.

### Properties of Current Solution {#access-control-properties}

- You can grant permissions for databases and tables even if they are not exist.
- If a table was deleted, all the privileges that correspond to this table are not revoked. So, if new table is created later with the same name all the privileges become again actual. To revoke privileges corresponding to the deleted table, you need to perform, for example, the `REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON db.table FROM ALL` query.
- There is no lifetime settings for privileges.

## User account {#user-account-management}

A user account is a configuration that allows to authorize someone in ClickHouse. A user account contains:

- Identification information.
- [Privileges](../sql_reference/statements/grant.md#grant-privileges) that define a scope of queries the user can perform.
- Hosts from which connection to the ClickHouse server is allowed.
- Granted and default roles.
- Settings with their constraints that apply by default at the user's login.
- Assigned settings profiles.

Privileges to a user account can be granted by the [GRANT](../sql_reference/statements/grant.md) query or by assigning [roles](#role-management). To revoke privileges from a user, ClickHouse provides the [REVOKE](../sql_reference/statements/revoke.md) query. To list privileges for a user, use the - [SHOW GRANTS](../sql_reference/statements/show.md#show-grants-statement) statement.

Management queries:

- [CREATE USER](../sql_reference/statements/create.md#create-user-statement)
- [ALTER USER](../sql_reference/statements/alter.md#alter-user-statement)
- [DROP USER](../sql_reference/statements/misc.md#drop-user-statement)
- [SHOW CREATE USER](../sql_reference/statements/show.md#show-create-user-statement)

### Settings Application {#access-control-settings-application}

Settings can be set by different ways: for a user account, in its granted roles and settings profiles. At a user login, if a setting is set in different access entities, the value and constrains of this setting are applied corresponding to the following hierarchy (from higher priority to lower):

1. User account setting.
2. The settings of default roles of the user account. If a setting is set in some roles, then order of the setting application is undefined.
3. The settings in settings profiles assigned to a user or to it default roles. If a setting is set in some profiles, then order of setting application is undefined.
4. Settings applied to all the server by default or in the [default profile](server_configuration_parameters/settings.md#default-profile).


## Role {#role-management}

Role is a container for access entities that can be granted to a user account.

Role contains:

- [Privileges](../sql_reference/statements/grant.md#grant-privileges)
- Settings and constraints
- List of granted roles

Management queries:

- [CREATE ROLE](../sql_reference/statements/create.md#create-role-statement)
- [ALTER ROLE](../sql_reference/statements/alter.md#alter-role-statement)
- [DROP ROLE](../sql_reference/statements/misc.md#drop-role-statement)
- [SET ROLE](../sql_reference/statements/misc.md#set-role-statement)
- [SET DEFAULT ROLE](../sql_reference/statements/misc.md#set-default-role-statement)
- [SHOW CREATE ROLE](../sql_reference/statements/show.md#show-create-role-statement)

Privileges to a role can be granted by the [GRANT](../sql_reference/statements/grant.md) query. To revoke privileges from a role ClickHouse provides the [REVOKE](../sql_reference/statements/revoke.md) query.

## Row Policy {#row-policy-management}

Row policy is a filter that defines which or rows is available for a user or for a role. Row policy contains filters for one specific table and list of roles and/or users which should use this row policy.

Management queries:

- [CREATE ROW POLICY](../sql_reference/statements/create.md#create-row-policy-statement)
- [ALTER ROW POLICY](../sql_reference/statements/alter.md#alter-row-policy-statement)
- [DROP ROW POLICY](../sql_reference/statements/misc.md#drop-row-policy-statement)
- [SHOW CREATE ROW POLICY](../sql_reference/statements/show.md#show-create-row-policy-statement)


## Settings Profile {#settings-profiles-management}

Settings profile is a collection of [settings](settings/index.md). Settings profile contains settings and constraints, and list of roles and/or users to which this quota is applied.

Management queries:

- [CREATE SETTINGS PROFILE](../sql_reference/statements/create.md#create-settings-profile-statement)
- [ALTER SETTINGS PROFILE](../sql_reference/statements/alter.md#alter-settings-profile-statement)
- [DROP SETTINGS PROFILE](../sql_reference/statements/misc.md#drop-settings-profile-statement)
- [SHOW CREATE SETTINGS PROFILE](../sql_reference/statements/show.md#show-create-settings-profile-statement)


## Quota {#quotas-management}

Quota limits resource usage. See [Quotas](quotas.md).

Quota contains a set of limits for some durations, and list of roles and/or users which should use this quota.

Management queries:

- [CREATE QUOTA](../sql_reference/statements/create.md#create-quota-statement)
- [ALTER QUOTA](../sql_reference/statements/alter.md#alter-quota-statement)
- [DROP QUOTA](../sql_reference/statements/misc.md#drop-quota-statement)
- [SHOW CREATE QUOTA](../sql_reference/statements/show.md#show-create-quota-statement)


## Enabling SQL-driven Access Control and Account Management {#enabling-access-control}

- Setup a directory for configurations storage.

    ClickHouse stores access entity configurations in the folder set in the [access_control_path](server_configuration_parameters/settings.md#access_control_path) server configuration parameter.

- Enable SQL-driven access control and account management for at least one user account.

    By default SQL-driven access control and account management is turned of for all users. You need to configure at least one user in the `users.xml` configuration file and assign 1 to the [access_management](settings/settings_users.md#access_management-user-setting) setting.
