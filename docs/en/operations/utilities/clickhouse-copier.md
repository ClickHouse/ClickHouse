# clickhouse-copier {#clickhouse-copier}

Copies data from the tables in one cluster to tables in another (or the same) cluster.

!!! warning "Warning"
    To get a consistent copy, the data in the source tables and partitions should not change during the entire process.

You can run multiple `clickhouse-copier` instances on different servers to perform the same job. ZooKeeper is used for syncing the processes.

After starting, `clickhouse-copier`:

-   Connects to ZooKeeper and receives:

    -   Copying jobs.
    -   The state of the copying jobs.

-   It performs the jobs.

    Each running process chooses the “closest” shard of the source cluster and copies the data into the destination cluster, resharding the data if necessary.

`clickhouse-copier` tracks the changes in ZooKeeper and applies them on the fly.

To reduce network traffic, we recommend running `clickhouse-copier` on the same server where the source data is located.

## Running Clickhouse-copier {#running-clickhouse-copier}

The utility should be run manually:

``` bash
$ clickhouse-copier --daemon --config zookeeper.xml --task-path /task/path --base-dir /path/to/dir
```

Parameters:

-   `daemon` — Starts `clickhouse-copier` in daemon mode.
-   `config` — The path to the `zookeeper.xml` file with the parameters for the connection to ZooKeeper.
-   `task-path` — The path to the ZooKeeper node. This node is used for syncing `clickhouse-copier` processes and storing tasks. Tasks are stored in `$task-path/description`.
-   `task-file` — Optional path to file with task configuration for initial upload to ZooKeeper.
-   `task-upload-force` — Force upload `task-file` even if node already exists.
-   `base-dir` — The path to logs and auxiliary files. When it starts, `clickhouse-copier` creates `clickhouse-copier_YYYYMMHHSS_<PID>` subdirectories in `$base-dir`. If this parameter is omitted, the directories are created in the directory where `clickhouse-copier` was launched.

                 NOTE: If the first worker starts insert data and detects that destination partition is not empty then the partition will
                 be dropped and refilled, take it into account if you already have some data in destination tables. You could directly
                 specify partitions that should be copied in <enabled_partitions/>, they should be in quoted format like partition column of
                 system.parts table.

                 Partition names should have the same format as

                 Since partition key of source and destination cluster could be different,
                 these partition names specify destination partitions.

                 NOTE: In spite of this section is optional (if it is not specified, all partitions will be copied),
                 it is strictly recommended to specify them explicitly.
                 If you already have some ready partitions on destination cluster they
                 will be removed at the start of the copying since they will be interpeted
                 as unfinished data from the previous copying!!!

`clickhouse-copier` tracks the changes in `/task/path/description` and applies them on the fly. For instance, if you change the value of `max_workers`, the number of processes running tasks will also change.
