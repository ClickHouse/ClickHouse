# Settings Overview

There are two main groups of ClickHouse settings:

- Global server settings
- Query-level settings

The main distinction between global server settings and query-level settings is that
global server settings must be set in configuration files while query-level settings
can be set in configuration files or with SQL queries.

Read about [global server settings](/docs/en/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings.md) to learn more about configuring your ClickHouse server at the global server level.

Read about [query-level settings](/docs/en/operations/settings/settings-query-level.md) to learn more about configuring your ClickHouse server at the query-level.
