description: 'Calculates the sum of the numbers and counts the number of rows at the
  same time. The function is used by ClickHouse query optimizer: if there are multiple
  `sum`, `count` or `avg` functions in a query, they can be replaced to single `sumCount`
  function to reuse the calculations. The function is rarely needed to use explicitly.'
