Aggregate function that calculates the minimum across a group of values.

Example:

```sql
SELECT min(salary) FROM employees;
```

```sql
SELECT department, min(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```

If you need non-aggregate function to choose a minimum of two values, see `least`:

```sql
SELECT least(a, b) FROM table;
```
