description: 'Aggregate function for re-sampling time series data for PromQL-like irate and idelta calculation'
sidebar_position: 224
slug: /sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference/timeSeriesLastTwoSamples
title: 'timeSeriesLastTwoSamples'
---

Aggregate function that takes time series data as pairs of timestamps and values and stores only at most 2 recent samples.

Arguments:
- `timestamp` - timestamp of the sample
- `value` - value of the time series corresponding to the `timestamp`
Also it is possible to pass multiple samples of timestamps and values as Arrays of equal size.

Return value:
A `Tuple(Array(DateTime), Array(Float64))` - a pair of arrays of equal length from 0 to 2. The first array contains the timestamps of sampled time series, the second array contains the corresponding values of the time series.

Example:
This aggregate function is intended to be used with a Materialized View and Aggregated table that stores re-sampled time series data for grid-aligned timestamps.
Consider the following example table for raw data, and a table for storing re-sampled data:

```sql
-- Table for raw data
CREATE TABLE t_raw_timeseries
(
    metric_id UInt64,
    timestamp DateTime64(3, 'UTC') CODEC(DoubleDelta, ZSTD),
    value Float64 CODEC(DoubleDelta)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (metric_id, timestamp);

-- Table with data re-sampled to bigger (15 sec) time steps
CREATE TABLE t_resampled_timeseries_15_sec
(
    metric_id UInt64,
    grid_timestamp DateTime('UTC') CODEC(DoubleDelta, ZSTD), -- Timestamp aligned to 15 sec
    samples AggregateFunction(timeSeriesLastTwoSamples, DateTime64(3, 'UTC'), Float64)
)
ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree()
ORDER BY (metric_id, grid_timestamp);

-- MV for populating re-sampled table
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_resampled_timeseries TO t_resampled_timeseries_15_sec
(
    metric_id UInt64,
    grid_timestamp DateTime('UTC') CODEC(DoubleDelta, ZSTD),
    samples AggregateFunction(timeSeriesLastTwoSamples, DateTime64(3, 'UTC'), Float64)
)
AS SELECT
    metric_id,
    ceil(toUnixTimestamp(timestamp + interval 999 millisecond) / 15, 0) * 15 AS grid_timestamp,   -- Round timestamp up to the next grid point
    initializeAggregation('timeSeriesLastTwoSamplesState', timestamp, value) AS samples
FROM t_raw_timeseries
ORDER BY metric_id, grid_timestamp;
```

Insert some test data and read the data between '2024-12-12 12:00:12' and '2024-12-12 12:00:30'
```sql
-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO t_raw_timeseries(metric_id, timestamp, value) SELECT number%10 AS metric_id, '2024-12-12 12:00:00'::DateTime64(3, 'UTC') + interval ((number/10)%100)*900 millisecond as timestamp, number%3+number%29 AS value FROM numbers(1000);

-- Check raw data
SELECT *
FROM t_raw_timeseries
WHERE metric_id = 3 AND timestamp BETWEEN '2024-12-12 12:00:12' AND '2024-12-12 12:00:31'
ORDER BY metric_id, timestamp;
```

Query last 2 sample for timestamps '2024-12-12 12:00:15' and '2024-12-12 12:00:30':
```sql
-- Check re-sampled data
SELECT metric_id, grid_timestamp, (finalizeAggregation(samples).1 as timestamp, finalizeAggregation(samples).2 as value) 
FROM t_resampled_timeseries_15_sec
WHERE metric_id = 3 AND grid_timestamp BETWEEN '2024-12-12 12:00:15' AND '2024-12-12 12:00:30'
ORDER BY metric_id, grid_timestamp;
```

```response

3    2024-12-12 12:00:30    (['2024-12-12 12:00:29.969','2024-12-12 12:00:29.069'],[14,6])
```

The aggregated table stores only last 2 values for each 15-second aligned timestamp. This allows to calculate PromQL-like `irate` and `idelta` by reading much less data then is stored in the raw table.

```sql
-- Calculate idelta and irate from the raw data
WITH
    '2024-12-12 12:00:15'::DateTime64(3,'UTC') AS start_ts,       -- start of timestamp grid
    start_ts + interval 60 second AS end_ts,   -- end of timestamp grid
    15 AS step_seconds,   -- step of timestamp grid
    45 AS window_seconds  -- "staleness" window
SELECT
    metric_id,
    timeSeriesInstantDeltaToGrid(start_ts, end_ts, step_seconds, window_seconds)(timestamp, value),
    timeSeriesInstantRateToGrid(start_ts, end_ts, step_seconds, window_seconds)(timestamp, value)
FROM t_raw_timeseries
WHERE metric_id = 3 AND timestamp BETWEEN start_ts - interval window_seconds seconds AND end_ts
GROUP BY metric_id;
```
