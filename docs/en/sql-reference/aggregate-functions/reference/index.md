# Aggregate Functions

ClickHouse supports all standard SQL aggregate functions ([sum](../reference/sum.md), [avg](../reference/avg.md), [min](../reference/min.md), [max](../reference/max.md), [count](../reference/count.md)), as well as a wide range of other aggregate functions.

<!-- The table of contents table for this page is automatically generated by

from the YAML front matter fields: slug, description, title.

If you've spotted an error, please edit the YML frontmatter of the pages themselves.
