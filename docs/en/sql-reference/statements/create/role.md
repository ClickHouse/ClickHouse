# CREATE ROLE {#create-role-statement}

Creates a new [role](../../../operations/access-rights.md#role-management). Role is a set of [privileges](../../../sql-reference/statements/grant.md#grant-privileges). A [user](../../../sql-reference/statements/create/user.md) assigned a role gets all the privileges of this role.

Syntax:

``` sql
CREATE ROLE [IF NOT EXISTS | OR REPLACE] name
    [SETTINGS variable [= value] [MIN [=] min_value] [MAX [=] max_value] [READONLY|WRITABLE] | PROFILE 'profile_name'] [,...]
```

## Managing Roles {#managing-roles}

A user can be assigned multiple roles. Users can apply their assigned roles in arbitrary combinations by the [SET ROLE](../../../sql-reference/statements/set-role.md) statement. The final scope of privileges is a combined set of all the privileges of all the applied roles. If a user has privileges granted directly to itâ€™s user account, they are also combined with the privileges granted by roles.

User can have default roles which apply at user login. To set default roles, use the [SET DEFAULT ROLE](../../../sql-reference/statements/set-role.md#set-default-role-statement) statement or the [ALTER USER](../../../sql-reference/statements/alter/user.md#alter-user-statement) statement.

To revoke a role, use the [REVOKE](../../../sql-reference/statements/revoke.md) statement.

To delete role, use the [DROP ROLE](../../../sql-reference/statements/drop.md#drop-role-statement) statement. The deleted role is being automatically revoked from all the users and roles to which it was assigned.

## Examples {#create-role-examples}

``` sql
CREATE ROLE accountant;
GRANT SELECT ON db.* TO accountant;
```

This sequence of queries creates the role `accountant` that has the privilege of reading data from the `accounting` database.

Assigning the role to the user `mira`:

``` sql
GRANT accountant TO mira;
```

After the role is assigned, the user can apply it and execute the allowed queries. For example:

``` sql
SET ROLE accountant;
SELECT * FROM db.*;
```
