# EXCHANGE Statement

Exchanges the names of two tables or dictionaries atomically.
This task can also be accomplished with a [RENAME](./rename.md) query using a temporary name, but the operation is not atomic in that case.

:::note    
The `EXCHANGE` query is supported by the [Atomic](../../engines/database-engines/atomic.md) database engine only.

```sql
EXCHANGE TABLES|DICTIONARIES [db0.]name_A AND [db1.]name_B [ON CLUSTER cluster]
```
