## EXPLAIN Types {#explain-types}

- `AST` — Abstract syntax tree.
- `SYNTAX` — Query text after AST-level optimizations.
- `QUERY TREE` — Query tree after Query Tree level optimizations.
- `PLAN` — Query execution plan.
- `PIPELINE` — Query execution pipeline.

### EXPLAIN AST {#explain-ast}

Dump query AST. Supports all types of queries, not only `SELECT`.

Examples:

```sql
EXPLAIN AST SELECT 1;
```

```sql
SelectWithUnionQuery (children 1)
 ExpressionList (children 1)
  SelectQuery (children 1)
   ExpressionList (children 1)
    Literal UInt64_1
```

```sql
EXPLAIN AST ALTER TABLE t1 DELETE WHERE date = today();
```

```sql
  explain
  AlterQuery  t1 (children 1)
   ExpressionList (children 1)
    AlterCommand 27 (children 1)
     Function equals (children 1)
      ExpressionList (children 2)
       Identifier date
       Function today (children 1)
        ExpressionList
```

### EXPLAIN SYNTAX {#explain-syntax}

Shows the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a query after syntax analysis.

It's done by parsing the query, constructing query AST and query tree, optionally running query analyzer and optimization passes, and then converting the query tree back to the query AST.

Settings:

- `oneline` – Print the query in one line. Default: `0`.
- `run_query_tree_passes` – Run query tree passes before dumping the query tree. Default: `0`.
- `query_tree_passes` – If `run_query_tree_passes` is set, specifies how many passes to run. Without specifying `query_tree_passes` it runs all the passes.

Examples:

```sql
EXPLAIN SYNTAX SELECT * FROM system.numbers AS a, system.numbers AS b, system.numbers AS c WHERE a.number = b.number AND b.number = c.number;
```

Output:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM system.numbers AS a, system.numbers AS b, system.numbers AS c
WHERE (a.number = b.number) AND (b.number = c.number)
```

With `run_query_tree_passes`:

```sql
EXPLAIN SYNTAX run_query_tree_passes = 1 SELECT * FROM system.numbers AS a, system.numbers AS b, system.numbers AS c WHERE a.number = b.number AND b.number = c.number;
```

Output:

```sql
SELECT
    __table1.number AS `a.number`,
    __table2.number AS `b.number`,
    __table3.number AS `c.number`
FROM system.numbers AS __table1
ALL INNER JOIN system.numbers AS __table2 ON __table1.number = __table2.number
ALL INNER JOIN system.numbers AS __table3 ON __table2.number = __table3.number
```

### EXPLAIN QUERY TREE {#explain-query-tree}

Settings:

- `run_passes` — Run all query tree passes before dumping the query tree. Default: `1`.
- `dump_passes` — Dump information about used passes before dumping the query tree. Default: `0`.
- `passes` — Specifies how many passes to run. If set to `-1`, runs all the passes. Default: `-1`.
- `dump_tree` — Display the query tree. Default: `1`.
- `dump_ast` — Display the query AST generated from the query tree. Default: `0`.

Example:
```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY TREE SELECT id, value FROM test_table;
```

```sql
QUERY id: 0
  PROJECTION COLUMNS
    id UInt64
    value String
  PROJECTION
    LIST id: 1, nodes: 2
      COLUMN id: 2, column_name: id, result_type: UInt64, source_id: 3
      COLUMN id: 4, column_name: value, result_type: String, source_id: 3
  JOIN TREE
    TABLE id: 3, table_name: default.test_table
```

### EXPLAIN PLAN {#explain-plan}

Dump query plan steps.

Settings:

- `header` — Prints output header for step. Default: 0.
- `description` — Prints step description. Default: 1.
- `indexes` — Shows used indexes, the number of filtered parts and the number of filtered granules for every index applied. Default: 0. Supported for [MergeTree](../../engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree.md) tables.
- `projections` — Shows all analyzed projections and their effect on part-level filtering based on projection primary key conditions. For each projection, this section includes statistics such as the number of parts, rows, marks, and ranges that were evaluated using the projection's primary key. It also shows how many data parts were skipped due to this filtering, without reading from the projection itself. Whether a projection was actually used for reading or only analyzed for filtering can be determined by the `description` field. Default: 0. Supported for [MergeTree](../../engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree.md) tables.
- `actions` — Prints detailed information about step actions. Default: 0.
- `json` — Prints query plan steps as a row in [JSON](../../interfaces/formats.md#json) format. Default: 0. It is recommended to use [TSVRaw](../../interfaces/formats.md#tabseparatedraw) format to avoid unnecessary escaping.

When `json=1` step names will contain an additional suffix with unique step identifier.

Example:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT sum(number) FROM numbers(10) GROUP BY number % 4;
```

```sql
Union
  Expression (Projection)
  Expression (Before ORDER BY and SELECT)
    Aggregating
      Expression (Before GROUP BY)
        SettingQuotaAndLimits (Set limits and quota after reading from storage)
          ReadFromStorage (SystemNumbers)
```

:::note
Step and query cost estimation is not supported.
:::

When `json = 1`, the query plan is represented in JSON format. Every node is a dictionary that always has the keys `Node Type` and `Plans`. `Node Type` is a string with a step name. `Plans` is an array with child step descriptions. Other optional keys may be added depending on node type and settings.

Example:

```sql
EXPLAIN json = 1, description = 0 SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 FORMAT TSVRaw;
```

```json
[
  {
    "Plan": {
      "Node Type": "Union",
      "Node Id": "Union_10",
      "Plans": [
        {
          "Node Type": "Expression",
          "Node Id": "Expression_13",
          "Plans": [
            {
              "Node Type": "ReadFromStorage",
              "Node Id": "ReadFromStorage_0"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "Node Type": "Expression",
          "Node Id": "Expression_16",
          "Plans": [
            {
              "Node Type": "ReadFromStorage",
              "Node Id": "ReadFromStorage_4"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

With `description` = 1, the `Description` key is added to the step:

```json
{
  "Node Type": "ReadFromStorage",
  "Description": "SystemOne"
}
```

With `header` = 1, the `Header` key is added to the step as an array of columns.

Example:

```sql
EXPLAIN json = 1, description = 0, header = 1 SELECT 1, 2 + dummy;
```

```json
[
  {
    "Plan": {
      "Node Type": "Expression",
      "Node Id": "Expression_5",
      "Header": [
        {
          "Name": "1",
          "Type": "UInt8"
        },
        {
          "Name": "plus(2, dummy)",
          "Type": "UInt16"
        }
      ],
      "Plans": [
        {
          "Node Type": "ReadFromStorage",
          "Node Id": "ReadFromStorage_0",
          "Header": [
            {
              "Name": "dummy",
              "Type": "UInt8"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

With `indexes` = 1, the `Indexes` key is added. It contains an array of used indexes. Each index is described as JSON with `Type` key (a string `MinMax`, `Partition`, `PrimaryKey` or `Skip`) and optional keys:

- `Name` — The index name (currently only used for `Skip` indexes).
- `Keys` — The array of columns used by the index.
- `Condition` —  The used condition.
- `Description` — The index description (currently only used for `Skip` indexes).
- `Parts` — The number of parts before/after the index is applied.
- `Granules` — The number of granules before/after the index is applied.

Example:

```json
"Node Type": "ReadFromMergeTree",
"Indexes": [
  {
    "Type": "MinMax",
    "Keys": ["y"],
    "Condition": "(y in [1, +inf))",
    "Parts": 5/4,
    "Granules": 12/11
  },
  {
    "Type": "Partition",
    "Keys": ["y", "bitAnd(z, 3)"],
    "Condition": "and((bitAnd(z, 3) not in [1, 1]), and((y in [1, +inf)), (bitAnd(z, 3) not in [1, 1])))",
    "Parts": 4/3,
    "Granules": 11/10
  },
  {
    "Type": "PrimaryKey",
    "Keys": ["x", "y"],
    "Condition": "and((x in [11, +inf)), (y in [1, +inf)))",
    "Parts": 3/2,
    "Granules": 10/6,
    "Search Algorithm": "generic exclusion search"
  },
  {
    "Type": "Skip",
    "Name": "t_minmax",
    "Description": "minmax GRANULARITY 2",
    "Parts": 2/1,
    "Granules": 6/2
  },
  {
    "Type": "Skip",
    "Name": "t_set",
    "Description": "set GRANULARITY 2",
    "": 1/1,
    "Granules": 2/1
  }
]
```

With `projections` = 1, the `Projections` key is added. It contains an array of analyzed projections. Each projection is described as JSON with following keys:

- `Name` — The projection name.
- `Condition` —  The used projection primary key condition.
- `Description` — The description of how the projection is used (e.g. part-level filtering).
- `Selected Parts` — Number of parts selected by the projection.
- `Selected Marks` — Number of marks selected.
- `Selected Ranges` — Number of ranges selected.
- `Selected Rows` — Number of rows selected.
- `Filtered Parts` — Number of parts skipped due to part-level filtering.

Example:

```json
"Node Type": "ReadFromMergeTree",
"Projections": [
  {
    "Name": "region_proj",
    "Description": "Projection has been analyzed and is used for part-level filtering",
    "Condition": "(region in ['us_west', 'us_west'])",
    "Search Algorithm": "binary search",
    "Selected Parts": 3,
    "Selected Marks": 3,
    "Selected Ranges": 3,
    "Selected Rows": 3,
    "Filtered Parts": 2
  },
  {
    "Name": "user_id_proj",
    "Description": "Projection has been analyzed and is used for part-level filtering",
    "Condition": "(user_id in [107, 107])",
    "Search Algorithm": "binary search",
    "Selected Parts": 1,
    "Selected Marks": 1,
    "Selected Ranges": 1,
    "Selected Rows": 1,
    "Filtered Parts": 2
  }
]
```

With `actions` = 1, added keys depend on step type.

Example:

```sql
EXPLAIN json = 1, actions = 1, description = 0 SELECT 1 FORMAT TSVRaw;
```

```json
[
  {
    "Plan": {
      "Node Type": "Expression",
      "Node Id": "Expression_5",
      "Expression": {
        "Inputs": [
          {
            "Name": "dummy",
            "Type": "UInt8"
          }
        ],
        "Actions": [
          {
            "Node Type": "INPUT",
            "Result Type": "UInt8",
            "Result Name": "dummy",
            "Arguments": [0],
            "Removed Arguments": [0],
            "Result": 0
          },
          {
            "Node Type": "COLUMN",
            "Result Type": "UInt8",
            "Result Name": "1",
            "Column": "Const(UInt8)",
            "Arguments": [],
            "Removed Arguments": [],
            "Result": 1
          }
        ],
        "Outputs": [
          {
            "Name": "1",
            "Type": "UInt8"
          }
        ],
        "Positions": [1]
      },
      "Plans": [
        {
          "Node Type": "ReadFromStorage",
          "Node Id": "ReadFromStorage_0"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### EXPLAIN PIPELINE {#explain-pipeline}

Settings:

- `header` — Prints header for each output port. Default: 0.
- `graph` — Prints a graph described in the [DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) graph description language. Default: 0.
- `compact` — Prints graph in compact mode if `graph` setting is enabled. Default: 1.

When `compact=0` and `graph=1` processor names will contain an additional suffix with unique processor identifier.

Example:

```sql
EXPLAIN PIPELINE SELECT sum(number) FROM numbers_mt(100000) GROUP BY number % 4;
```

```sql
(Union)
(Expression)
ExpressionTransform
  (Expression)
  ExpressionTransform
    (Aggregating)
    Resize 2 → 1
      AggregatingTransform × 2
        (Expression)
        ExpressionTransform × 2
          (SettingQuotaAndLimits)
            (ReadFromStorage)
            NumbersRange × 2 0 → 1
```
### EXPLAIN ESTIMATE {#explain-estimate}

Shows the estimated number of rows, marks and parts to be read from the tables while processing the query. Works with tables in the [MergeTree](/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree) family. 

**Example**

Creating a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ttt (i Int64) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY i SETTINGS index_granularity = 16, write_final_mark = 0;
INSERT INTO ttt SELECT number FROM numbers(128);
OPTIMIZE TABLE ttt;
```

Query:

```sql
EXPLAIN ESTIMATE SELECT * FROM ttt;
```

Result:

```text
┌─database─┬─table─┬─parts─┬─rows─┬─marks─┐
│ default  │ ttt   │     1 │  128 │     8 │
└──────────┴───────┴───────┴──────┴───────┘
```

### EXPLAIN TABLE OVERRIDE {#explain-table-override}

Shows the result of a table override on a table schema accessed through a table function.
Also does some validation, throwing an exception if the override would have caused some kind of failure.

**Example**

Assume you have a remote MySQL table like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE db.tbl (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    created DATETIME DEFAULT now()
)
```

```sql
EXPLAIN TABLE OVERRIDE mysql('127.0.0.1:3306', 'db', 'tbl', 'root', 'clickhouse')
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(assumeNotNull(created))
```

Result:

```text
┌─explain─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PARTITION BY uses columns: `created` Nullable(DateTime) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

:::note
The validation is not complete, so a successful query does not guarantee that the override would not cause issues.
