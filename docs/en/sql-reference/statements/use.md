# USE Statement {#use}

``` sql
USE db
```

Lets you set the current database for the session.

The current database is used for searching for tables if the database is not explicitly defined in the query with a dot before the table name.

This query canâ€™t be made when using the HTTP protocol, since there is no concept of a session.
