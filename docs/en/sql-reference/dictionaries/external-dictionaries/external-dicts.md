# External Dictionaries {#dicts-external-dicts}

You can add your own dictionaries from various data sources. The data source for a dictionary can be a local text or executable file, an HTTP(s) resource, or another DBMS. For more information, see “[Sources for external dictionaries](external-dicts-dict-sources.md)”.

ClickHouse:

-   Fully or partially stores dictionaries in RAM.
-   Periodically updates dictionaries and dynamically loads missing values. In other words, dictionaries can be loaded dynamically.
-   Allows to create external dictionaries with xml files or [DDL queries](../../statements/create.md#create-dictionary-query).

The configuration of external dictionaries can be located in one or more xml-files. The path to the configuration is specified in the [dictionaries\_config](../../../operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings.md#server_configuration_parameters-dictionaries_config) parameter.

Dictionaries can be loaded at server startup or at first use, depending on the [dictionaries\_lazy\_load](../../../operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings.md#server_configuration_parameters-dictionaries_lazy_load) setting.

The [dictionaries](../../../operations/system-tables.md#system_tables-dictionaries) system table contains information about dictionaries configured at server. For each dictionary you can find there:

- Status of the dictionary.
- Configuration parameters.
- Metrics like amount of RAM allocated for the dictionary or a number of queries since the dictionary was successfully loaded.

The dictionary configuration file has the following format:

``` xml
<yandex>
    <comment>An optional element with any content. Ignored by the ClickHouse server.</comment>

    <!--Optional element. File name with substitutions-->
    <include_from>/etc/metrika.xml</include_from>


    <dictionary>
        <!-- Dictionary configuration. -->
        <!-- There can be any number of <dictionary> sections in the configuration file. -->
    </dictionary>

</yandex>
```

You can [configure](external-dicts-dict.md) any number of dictionaries in the same file.

[DDL queries for dictionaries](../../statements/create.md#create-dictionary-query) doesn’t require any additional records in server configuration. They allow to work with dictionaries as first-class entities, like tables or views.

    You can convert values for a small dictionary by describing it in a `SELECT` query (see the [transform](../../../sql-reference/functions/other-functions.md) function). This functionality is not related to external dictionaries.
