# LowCardinality

Changes the internal representation of other data types to be dictionary-encoded.

## Syntax

``` sql
LowCardinality(data_type)
```

**Parameters**

- `data_type` — [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md), [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md), [Date](../../sql-reference/data-types/date.md), [DateTime](../../sql-reference/data-types/datetime.md), and numbers excepting [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md). `LowCardinality` is not efficient for some data types, see the [allow_suspicious_low_cardinality_types](../../operations/settings/settings.md#allow_suspicious_low_cardinality_types) setting description.

## Description

`LowCardinality` is a superstructure that changes a data storage method and rules of data processing. ClickHouse applies [dictionary coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_coder) to `LowCardinality`-columns. Operating with dictionary encoded data significantly increases performance of [SELECT](../../sql-reference/statements/select/index.md) queries for many applications.

The efficiency of using `LowCardinality` data type depends on data diversity. If a dictionary contains less than 10,000 distinct values, then ClickHouse mostly shows higher efficiency of data reading and storing. If a dictionary contains more than 100,000 distinct values, then ClickHouse can perform worse in comparison with using ordinary data types.

Consider using `LowCardinality` instead of [Enum](../../sql-reference/data-types/enum.md) when working with strings. `LowCardinality` provides more flexibility in use and often reveals the same or higher efficiency.

## Example

Create a table with a `LowCardinality`-column:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE lc_t
(
    `id` UInt16,
    `strings` LowCardinality(String)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY id
```
