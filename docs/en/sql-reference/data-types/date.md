# Date

A date. Stored in two bytes as the number of days since 1970-01-01 (unsigned). Allows storing values from just after the beginning of the Unix Epoch to the upper threshold defined by a constant at the compilation stage (currently, this is until the year 2149, but the final fully-supported year is 2148).

Supported range of values: \[1970-01-01, 2149-06-06\].

The date value is stored without the time zone.

**Example**

Creating a table with a `Date`-type column and inserting data into it:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE dt
(
    `timestamp` Date,
    `event_id` UInt8
)
ENGINE = TinyLog;
```

``` sql
-- Parse Date
-- - from string,
-- - from 'small' integer interpreted as number of days since 1970-01-01, and
-- - from 'big' integer interpreted as number of seconds since 1970-01-01.
INSERT INTO dt VALUES ('2019-01-01', 1), (17897, 2), (1546300800, 3);

SELECT * FROM dt;
```

``` text
┌──timestamp─┬─event_id─┐
│ 2019-01-01 │        1 │
│ 2019-01-01 │        2 │
│ 2019-01-01 │        3 │
└────────────┴──────────┘
```
