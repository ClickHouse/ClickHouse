# Comparison Functions

Below comparison functions return 0 or 1 as Uint8.

The following types can be compared:
- numbers
- strings and fixed strings
- dates
- dates with times

Only values within the same group can be compared (e.g. UInt16 and UInt64) but not across groups (e.g. UInt16 and DateTime).

Strings are compared byte-by-byte. Note that this may lead to unexpected results if one of the strings contains UTF-8 encoded multi-byte characters.

A string S1 which has another string S2 as prefix is considered longer than S2.
