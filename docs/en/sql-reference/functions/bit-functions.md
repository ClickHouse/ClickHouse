# Bit functions

Bit functions work for any pair of types from `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, `UInt64`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `Float32`, or `Float64`. Some functions support `String` and `FixedString` types.

The result type is an integer with bits equal to the maximum bits of its arguments. If at least one of the arguments is signed, the result is a signed number. If an argument is a floating-point number, it is cast to Int64.
