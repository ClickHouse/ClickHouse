# Functions for Searching in Strings

All functions in this section search case-sensitively by default. Case-insensitive search is usually provided by separate function variants.

:::note
Case-insensitive search follows the lowercase-uppercase rules of the English language. E.g. Uppercased `i` in the English language is
`I` whereas in the Turkish language it is `Ä°` - results for languages other than English may be unexpected.
:::

Functions in this section also assume that the searched string (referred to in this section as `haystack`) and the search string (referred to in this section as `needle`) are single-byte encoded text. If this assumption is
violated, no exception is thrown and results are undefined. Search with UTF-8 encoded strings is usually provided by separate function
variants. Likewise, if a UTF-8 function variant is used and the input strings are not UTF-8 encoded text, no exception is thrown and the
results are undefined. Note that no automatic Unicode normalization is performed, however you can use the
[normalizeUTF8*()](https://clickhouse.com../functions/string-functions/) functions for that.

[General strings functions](string-functions.md) and [functions for replacing in strings](string-replace-functions.md) are described separately.
