# Introspection functions

You can use functions described in this chapter to introspect [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) and [DWARF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF) for query profiling.

:::note
These functions are slow and may impose security considerations.
:::

For proper operation of introspection functions:

- Install the `clickhouse-common-static-dbg` package.

- Set the [allow_introspection_functions](../../operations/settings/settings.md#allow_introspection_functions) setting to 1.

        For security reasons introspection functions are disabled by default.

ClickHouse saves profiler reports to the [trace_log](/operations/system-tables/trace_log) system table. Make sure the table and profiler are configured properly.
