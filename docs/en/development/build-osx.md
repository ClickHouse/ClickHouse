# How to Build ClickHouse on macOS for macOS

:::info You don't need to build ClickHouse yourself!
You can install pre-built ClickHouse as described in [Quick Start](https://clickhouse.com/#quick-start).
:::

ClickHouse can be compiled on macOS x86_64 (Intel) and arm64 (Apple Silicon) using on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or higher.

As compiler, only Clang from homebrew is supported.

Building with Apple's XCode `apple-clang` is not recommended, it may break in arbitrary ways.

## Install Prerequisites

First install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Next, run:

``` bash
brew update
brew install ccache cmake ninja libtool gettext llvm gcc binutils grep findutils nasm
```

For Apple XCode Clang (discouraged), install the latest [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/am/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) the from App Store.
Open it at least once to accept the end-user license agreement and automatically install the required components.
Then, make sure that the latest Command Line Tools are installed and selected in the system:

``` bash
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
sudo xcode-select --install
```

:::note
Apple uses a case-insensitive file system by default. While this usually does not affect compilation (especially scratch makes will work), it can confuse file operations like `git mv`.
For serious development on macOS, make sure that the source code is stored on a case-sensitive disk volume, e.g. see [these instructions](https://brianboyko.medium.com/a-case-sensitive-src-folder-for-mac-programmers-176cc82a3830).

## Build ClickHouse

To build using Homebrew's Clang compiler:

``` bash
cd ClickHouse
mkdir build
export PATH=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin:$PATH
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang++ -S . -B build
cmake --build build
# The resulting binary will be created at: build/programs/clickhouse
```

To build using XCode native AppleClang compiler in XCode IDE (not recommended):

``` bash
cd ClickHouse
rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build
XCODE_IDE=1 ALLOW_APPLECLANG=1 cmake -G Xcode -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_JEMALLOC=OFF ..
cmake --open .
# ...then, in XCode IDE select ALL_BUILD scheme and start the building process.
# The resulting binary will be created at: ./programs/Debug/clickhouse
```

## Caveats

If you intend to run `clickhouse-server`, make sure to increase the system’s `maxfiles` variable.

:::note
You’ll need to use sudo.
:::

To do so, create the `/Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist` file with the following content:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
        "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>limit.maxfiles</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
      <string>launchctl</string>
      <string>limit</string>
      <string>maxfiles</string>
      <string>524288</string>
      <string>524288</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>ServiceIPC</key>
    <false/>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

Give the file correct permissions:

``` bash
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
```

Validate that the file is correct:

``` bash
plutil /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
```

Load the file (or reboot):

``` bash
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
```

To check if it’s working, use the `ulimit -n` or `launchctl limit maxfiles` commands.
