# Getting Started Guide for Building ClickHouse

ClickHouse can be build on Linux, FreeBSD and macOS. If you use Windows, you can still build ClickHouse in a virtual machine running Linux, e.g. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) with Ubuntu.

ClickHouse requires a 64-bit system to compile and run, 32-bit systems do not work.

## Creating a Repository on GitHub {#creating-a-repository-on-github}

To start developing for ClickHouse you will need a [GitHub](https://www.virtualbox.org/) account. Please also generate a SSH key locally (if you don't have one already) and upload the public key to GitHub as this is a prerequisite for contributing patches.

Next, create a fork of the [ClickHouse repository](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/) in your personal account by clicking the "fork" button in the upper right corner.

To contribute, e.g. a fix for an issue or a feature, please commit your changes to a branch in your fork, then create a "pull request" with the changes to the main repository.

For working with Git repositories, please install `git`. In Ubuntu run these commands in a terminal:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

A cheatsheet for using Git can be found [here](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf). The detailed manual for Git is [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## Cloning a Repository to Your Development Machine {#cloning-a-repository-to-your-development-machine}

First, download the source files to your working machine, i.e. clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:your_github_username/ClickHouse.git  # replace placeholder with your GitHub user name
cd ClickHouse
```

This command creates a directory `ClickHouse/` containing the source code of ClickHouse. If you specify a custom checkout directory after the URL but it is important that this path does not contain whitespaces as it may lead to problems with the build later on.

The ClickHouse repository uses Git submodules, i.e. references to external repositories (usually 3rd party libraries used by ClickHouse). These are not checked out by default. To do so, you can either

- run `git clone` with option `--recurse-submodules`,

- if `git clone` did not check out submodules, run `git submodule update --init --jobs <N>` (e.g. `<N> = 12` to parallelize the checkout) to achieve the same as the previous alternative, or

- if `git clone` did not check out submodules and you like to use [sparse](https://github.blog/2020-01-17-bring-your-monorepo-down-to-size-with-sparse-checkout/) and [shallow](https://github.blog/2020-12-21-get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/) submodule checkout to omit unneeded files and history in submodules to save space (ca. 5 GB instead of ca. 15 GB), run `./contrib/update-submodules.sh`. Not really recommended as it generally makes working with submodules less convenient and slower.

You can check the Git status with the command: `git submodule status`.

If you get the following error message

    Permission denied (publickey).
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.

it generally means that the SSH keys for connecting to GitHub are missing. These keys are normally located in `~/.ssh`. For SSH keys to be accepted you need to upload them in GitHub's settings.

You can also clone the repository via https protocol:

    git clone --recursive --shallow-submodules https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse.git

This, however, will not let you send your changes to the server. You can still use it temporarily and add the SSH keys later replacing the remote address of the repository with `git remote` command.

You can also add original ClickHouse repo address to your local repository to pull updates from there:

    git remote add upstream git@github.com:ClickHouse/ClickHouse.git

After successfully running this command you will be able to pull updates from the main ClickHouse repo by running `git pull upstream master`.

:::note 
Instructions below assume you are building on Linux. If you are cross-compiling or building on macOS, please also check for operating system and architecture specific guides, such as building [on macOS for macOS](build-osx.md), [on Linux for macOS](build-cross-osx.md), [on Linux for Linux/RISC-V](build-cross-riscv.md) and so on.
:::

## Build System {#build-system}

ClickHouse uses CMake and Ninja for building.

- CMake - a meta-build system that can generate Ninja files (build tasks).

- Ninja - a smaller build system with a focus on the speed used to execute those cmake generated tasks.

To install on Ubuntu, Debian or Mint run `sudo apt install cmake ninja-build`.

On CentOS, RedHat run `sudo yum install cmake ninja-build`.

If you use Arch or Gentoo, you probably know it yourself how to install CMake.

## C++ Compiler {#c-compiler}

Compilers Clang starting from version 15 is supported for building ClickHouse.

Clang should be used instead of gcc. Though, our continuous integration (CI) platform runs checks for about a dozen of build combinations.

On Ubuntu/Debian you can use the automatic installation script (check [official webpage](https://apt.llvm.org/))

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh)"
```

## The Building Process {#the-building-process}

Now that you are ready to build ClickHouse we recommend you to create a separate directory `build` inside `ClickHouse` that will contain all of the build artefacts:

    mkdir build
    cd build

You can have several different directories (build_release, build_debug, etc.) for different types of build.

While inside the `build` directory, configure your build by running CMake. Before the first run, you need to define environment variables that specify compiler.

    export CC=clang CXX=clang++
    cmake ..

If you installed clang using the automatic installation script above, also specify the version of clang installed in the first command, e.g. `export CC=clang-17 CXX=clang++-17`. The clang version will be in the script output.

The `CC` variable specifies the compiler for C (short for C Compiler), and `CXX` variable instructs which C++ compiler is to be used for building.

For a faster build, you can resort to the `debug` build type - a build with no optimizations. For that supply the following parameter `-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`:

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

You can change the type of build by running this command in the `build` directory.

Run ninja to build:

    ninja clickhouse-server clickhouse-client

Only the required binaries are going to be built in this example.

If you require to build all the binaries (utilities and tests), you should run ninja with no parameters:

    ninja

Full build requires about 30GB of free disk space or 15GB to build the main binaries.

When a large amount of RAM is available on build machine you should limit the number of build tasks run in parallel with `-j` parameter:

    ninja -j 1 clickhouse-server clickhouse-client

On machines with 4GB of RAM, it is recommended to specify 1, for 8GB of RAM `-j 2` is recommended.

If you get the message: `ninja: error: loading 'build.ninja': No such file or directory`, it means that generating a build configuration has failed and you need to inspect the message above.

Upon the successful start of the building process, you’ll see the build progress - the number of processed tasks and the total number of tasks.

While building messages about LLVM library may show up. They affect nothing and are safe to be ignored.

Upon successful build you get an executable file `ClickHouse/<build_dir>/programs/clickhouse`:

    ls -l programs/clickhouse

## Running the Built Executable of ClickHouse {#running-the-built-executable-of-clickhouse}

To run the server under the current user you need to navigate to `ClickHouse/programs/server/` (located outside of `build`) and run:

    ../../build/programs/clickhouse server

In this case, ClickHouse will use config files located in the current directory. You can run `clickhouse server` from any directory specifying the path to a config file as a command-line parameter `--config-file`.

To connect to ClickHouse with clickhouse-client in another terminal navigate to `ClickHouse/build/programs/` and run `./clickhouse client`.

If you get `Connection refused` message on macOS or FreeBSD, try specifying host address 127.0.0.1:

    clickhouse client --host 127.0.0.1

You can replace the production version of ClickHouse binary installed in your system with your custom-built ClickHouse binary. To do that install ClickHouse on your machine following the instructions from the official website. Next, run the following:

    sudo service clickhouse-server stop
    sudo cp ClickHouse/build/programs/clickhouse /usr/bin/
    sudo service clickhouse-server start

Note that `clickhouse-client`, `clickhouse-server` and others are symlinks to the commonly shared `clickhouse` binary.

You can also run your custom-built ClickHouse binary with the config file from the ClickHouse package installed on your system:

    sudo service clickhouse-server stop
    sudo -u clickhouse ClickHouse/build/programs/clickhouse server --config-file /etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml

## IDE (Integrated Development Environment) {#ide-integrated-development-environment}

**CLion (recommended)**

If you do not know which IDE to use, we recommend that you use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/). CLion is commercial software but it offers a 30 day free trial. It is also free of charge for students. CLion can be used on both Linux and macOS.

A few things to know when using CLion to develop ClickHouse:

- CLion creates a `build` path on its own and automatically selects `debug` for the build type
- It uses a version of CMake that is defined in CLion and not the one installed by you
- CLion will use `make` to run build tasks instead of `ninja` (this is normal behavior)

**Other alternatives**

[KDevelop](https://kdevelop.org/) and [QTCreator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools) are other great alternative IDEs for developing ClickHouse. While KDevelop is a great IDE, it is sometimes unstable. If KDevelop crashes when opening a project, you should click the “Stop All” button as soon as it has opened the list of project’s files. After doing so, KDevelop should be fine to work with.

Other IDEs you can use are [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) (all of which are available on Linux). If you are using VS Code, we recommend using the [clangd extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd) to replace IntelliSense as it is much more performant.

## Test Data {#test-data}

Developing ClickHouse often requires loading realistic datasets. It is particularly important for performance testing. We have a specially prepared set of anonymized data of web analytics. It requires additionally some 3GB of free disk space. Note that this data is not required to accomplish most of the development tasks.

    sudo apt install wget xz-utils

    wget https://datasets.clickhouse.com/hits/tsv/hits_v1.tsv.xz
    wget https://datasets.clickhouse.com/visits/tsv/visits_v1.tsv.xz

    xz -v -d hits_v1.tsv.xz
    xz -v -d visits_v1.tsv.xz

## Creating Pull Request {#creating-pull-request}

Navigate to your fork repository in GitHub’s UI. If you have been developing in a branch, you need to select that branch. There will be a “Pull request” button located on the screen. In essence, this means “create a request for accepting my changes into the main repository”.

A pull request can be created even if the work is not completed yet. In this case please put the word “WIP” (work in progress) at the beginning of the title, it can be changed later. This is useful for cooperative reviewing and discussion of changes as well as for running all of the available tests. It is important that you provide a brief description of your changes, it will later be used for generating release changelog.

Testing will commence as soon as ClickHouse employees label your PR with a tag “can be tested”. The results of some first checks (e.g. code style) will come in within several minutes. Build check results will arrive within half an hour. And the main set of tests will report itself within an hour.

The system will prepare ClickHouse binary builds for your pull request individually. To retrieve these builds click the “Details” link next to “ClickHouse build check” entry in the list of checks. There you will find direct links to the built .deb packages of ClickHouse which you can deploy even on your production servers (if you have no fear).

Most probably some of the builds will fail at first times. This is due to the fact that we check builds both with gcc as well as with clang, with almost all of existing warnings (always with the `-Werror` flag) enabled for clang. On that same page, you can find all of the build logs so that you do not have to build ClickHouse in all of the possible ways.

## Browse ClickHouse Source Code {#browse-clickhouse-source-code}

You can use GitHub integrated code browser [here](https://github.dev/ClickHouse/ClickHouse).

Also, you can browse sources on [GitHub](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) as usual.

If you are not interested in functionality provided by third-party libraries, you can further speed up the build using `cmake` options
```
-DENABLE_LIBRARIES=0
```

In case of problems with any of the development options, you are on your own!
