* Made `indexOf()` use BloomFilter. [#14977](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14977) ([achimbab](https://github.com/achimbab)).

#### Performance Improvement

* Use Floyd-Rivest algorithm, it is the best for the ClickHouse use case of partial sorting. Bechmarks are in https://github.com/danlark1/miniselect and [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DHEaeXgZuX6AJ9eByeZ8iQVQv0ueP8XM). [#16825](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16825) ([Danila Kutenin](https://github.com/danlark1)).
* Now `ReplicatedMergeTree` tree engines family uses a separate thread pool for replicated fetches. Size of the pool limited by setting `background_fetches_pool_size` which can be tuned with a server restart. The default value of the setting is 3 and it means that the maximum amount of parallel fetches is equal to 3 (and it allows to utilize 10G network). Fixes #520. [#16390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16390) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

* Now we can safely prune partitions with exact match. Useful case: Suppose table is partitioned by `intHash64(x) % 100` and the query has condition on `intHash64(x) % 100` verbatim, not on x. [#16253](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16253) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

### ClickHouse release v20.11.3.3-stable, 2020-11-13

#### Bug Fix

* Fix rare silent crashes when query profiler is on and ClickHouse is installed on OS with glibc version that has (supposedly) broken asynchronous unwind tables for some functions. This fixes [#15301](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15301). This fixes [#13098](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13098). [#16846](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16846) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).


### ClickHouse release v20.11.2.1, 2020-11-11

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* If some `profile` was specified in `distributed_ddl` config section, then this profile could overwrite settings of `default` profile on server startup. It's fixed, now settings of distributed DDL queries should not affect global server settings. [#16635](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16635) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Restrict to use of non-comparable data types (like `AggregateFunction`) in keys (Sorting key, Primary key, Partition key, and so on). [#16601](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16601) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Remove `ANALYZE` and `AST` queries, and make the setting `enable_debug_queries` obsolete since now it is the part of full featured `EXPLAIN` query. [#16536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16536) ([Ivan](https://github.com/abyss7)).
* Aggregate functions `boundingRatio`, `rankCorr`, `retention`, `timeSeriesGroupSum`, `timeSeriesGroupRateSum`, `windowFunnel` were erroneously made case-insensitive. Now their names are made case sensitive as designed. Only functions that are specified in SQL standard or made for compatibility with other DBMS or functions similar to those should be case-insensitive. [#16407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16407) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Make `rankCorr` function return nan on insufficient data [#16124](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16124). [#16135](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16135) ([hexiaoting](https://github.com/hexiaoting)).
* When upgrading from versions older than 20.5, if rolling update is performed and cluster contains both versions 20.5 or greater and less than 20.5, if ClickHouse nodes with old versions are restarted and old version has been started up in presence of newer versions, it may lead to `Part ... intersects previous part` errors. To prevent this error, first install newer clickhouse-server packages on all cluster nodes and then do restarts (so, when clickhouse-server is restarted, it will start up with the new version).

#### New Feature

* Added support of LDAP as a user directory for locally non-existent users. [#12736](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12736) ([Denis Glazachev](https://github.com/traceon)).
* Add `system.replicated_fetches` table which shows currently running background fetches. [#16428](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16428) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Added setting `date_time_output_format`. [#15845](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15845) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Added minimal web UI to ClickHouse. [#16158](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16158) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allows to read/write Single protobuf message at once (w/o length-delimiters). [#15199](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15199) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Added initial OpenTelemetry support. ClickHouse now accepts OpenTelemetry traceparent headers over Native and HTTP protocols, and passes them downstream in some cases. The trace spans for executed queries are saved into the `system.opentelemetry_span_log` table. [#14195](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14195) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm)).
* Allow specify primary key in column list of `CREATE TABLE` query. This is needed for compatibility with other SQL dialects. [#15823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15823) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Implement `OFFSET offset_row_count {ROW | ROWS} FETCH {FIRST | NEXT} fetch_row_count {ROW | ROWS} {ONLY | WITH TIES}` in SELECT query with ORDER BY. This is the SQL-standard way to specify `LIMIT`. [#15855](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15855) ([hexiaoting](https://github.com/hexiaoting)).
* `errorCodeToName` function - return variable name of the error (useful for analyzing query_log and similar). `system.errors` table - shows how many times errors has been happened (respects `system_events_show_zero_values`). [#16438](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16438) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added function `untuple` which is a special function which can introduce new columns to the SELECT list by expanding a named tuple. [#16242](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16242) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai), [Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Now we can provide identifiers via query parameters. And these parameters can be used as table objects or columns. [#16594](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16594) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Added big integers (UInt256, Int128, Int256) and UUID data types support for MergeTree BloomFilter index. Big integers is an experimental feature. [#16642](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16642) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Add `farmFingerprint64` function (non-cryptographic string hashing). [#16570](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16570) ([Jacob Hayes](https://github.com/JacobHayes)).
* Add `log_queries_min_query_duration_ms`, only queries slower than the value of this setting will go to `query_log`/`query_thread_log` (i.e. something like `slow_query_log` in mysql). [#16529](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16529) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Ability to create a docker image on the top of `Alpine`. Uses precompiled binary and glibc components from ubuntu 20.04. [#16479](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16479) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Added `toUUIDOrNull`, `toUUIDOrZero` cast functions. [#16337](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16337) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Add `max_concurrent_queries_for_all_users` setting, see [#6636](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6636) for use cases. [#16154](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16154) ([nvartolomei](https://github.com/nvartolomei)).
* Add a new option `print_query_id` to clickhouse-client. It helps generate arbitrary strings with the current query id generated by the client. Also print query id in clickhouse-client by default. [#15809](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15809) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Add `tid` and `logTrace` functions. This closes [#9434](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9434). [#15803](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15803) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasFL)).
* Add function `formatReadableTimeDelta` that format time delta to human readable string ... [#15497](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15497) ([Filipe Caixeta](https://github.com/filipecaixeta)).
* Added `disable_merges` option for volumes in multi-disk configuration. [#13956](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13956) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon)).

#### Experimental Feature

* New functions `encrypt`, `aes_encrypt_mysql`, `decrypt`, `aes_decrypt_mysql`. These functions are working slowly, so we consider it as an experimental feature. [#11844](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11844) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk)).

#### Bug Fix

* Mask password in data_path in the `system.distribution_queue`. [#16727](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16727) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix `IN` operator over several columns and tuples with enabled `transform_null_in` setting. Fixes [#15310](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15310). [#16722](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16722) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* The setting `max_parallel_replicas` worked incorrectly if the queried table has no sampling. This fixes [#5733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5733). [#16675](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16675) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix optimize_read_in_order/optimize_aggregation_in_order with max_threads > 0 and expression in ORDER BY. [#16637](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16637) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Calculation of `DEFAULT` expressions was involving possible name collisions (that was very unlikely to encounter). This fixes [#9359](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9359). [#16612](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16612) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix `query_thread_log.query_duration_ms` unit. [#16563](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16563) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix a bug when using MySQL Master -> MySQL Slave -> ClickHouse MaterializeMySQL Engine. `MaterializeMySQL` is an experimental feature. [#16504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16504) ([TCeason](https://github.com/TCeason)).
* Specifically crafted argument of `round` function with `Decimal` was leading to integer division by zero. This fixes [#13338](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13338). [#16451](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16451) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fix processing of very large entries in replication queue. Very large entries may appear in ALTER queries if table structure is extremely large (near 1 MB). This fixes [#16307](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16307). [#16332](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16332) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fixed the inconsistent behaviour when a part of return data could be dropped because the set for its filtration wasn't created. [#16308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16308) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Fix dictGet in sharding_key (and similar places, i.e. when the function context is stored permanently). [#16205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16205) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix the exception thrown in `clickhouse-local` when trying to execute `OPTIMIZE` command. Fixes [#16076](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16076). [#16192](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16192) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Fixes [#15780](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15780) regression, e.g. `indexOf([1, 2, 3], toLowCardinality(1))` now is prohibited but it should not be. [#16038](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16038) ([Mike](https://github.com/myrrc)).
* Fix bug with MySQL database. When MySQL server used as database engine is down some queries raise Exception, because they try to get tables from disabled server, while it's unnecessary. For example, query `SELECT ... FROM system.parts` should work only with MergeTree tables and don't touch MySQL database at all. [#16032](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16032) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Now exception will be thrown when `ALTER MODIFY COLUMN ... DEFAULT ...` has incompatible default with column type. Fixes [#15854](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15854). [#15858](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15858) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

#### Improvement

* Treat `INTERVAL '1 hour'` as equivalent to `INTERVAL 1 HOUR`, to be compatible with Postgres and similar. This fixes [#15637](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15637). [#15978](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15978) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasFL)).
* Enable parsing enum values by their numeric ids for CSV, TSV and JSON input formats. [#15685](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15685) ([vivarum](https://github.com/vivarum)).
* Better read task scheduling for JBOD architecture and `MergeTree` storage. New setting `read_backoff_min_concurrency` which serves as the lower limit to the number of reading threads. [#16423](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16423) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Add missing support for `LowCardinality` in `Avro` format. [#16521](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16521) ([Mike](https://github.com/myrrc)).
* Workaround for use `S3` with nginx server as proxy. Nginx currenty does not accept urls with empty path like `http://domain.com?delete`, but vanilla aws-sdk-cpp produces this kind of urls. This commit uses patched aws-sdk-cpp version, which makes urls with "/" as path in this cases, like `http://domain.com/?delete`. [#16814](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16814) ([ianton-ru](https://github.com/ianton-ru)).
* Better diagnostics on parse errors in input data. Provide row number on `Cannot read all data` errors. [#16644](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16644) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Make the behaviour of `minMap` and `maxMap` more desireable. It will not skip zero values in the result. Fixes [#16087](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16087). [#16631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16631) ([Ildus Kurbangaliev](https://github.com/ildus)).
* Better update of ZooKeeper configuration in runtime. [#16630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16630) ([sundyli](https://github.com/sundy-li)).
* Apply SETTINGS clause as early as possible. It allows to modify more settings in the query. This closes [#3178](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/3178). [#16619](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16619) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Now `event_time_microseconds` field stores in Decimal64, not UInt64. [#16617](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16617) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Now paratmeterized functions can be used in `APPLY` column transformer. [#16589](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16589) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Improve scheduling of background task which removes data of dropped tables in `Atomic` databases. `Atomic` databases do not create broken symlink to table data directory if table actually has no data directory. [#16584](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16584) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Subqueries in `WITH` section (CTE) can reference previous subqueries in `WITH` section by their name. [#16575](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16575) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Add current_database into `system.query_thread_log`. [#16558](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16558) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Allow to fetch parts that are already committed or outdated in the current instance into the detached directory. It's useful when migrating tables from another cluster and having N to 1 shards mapping. It's also consistent with the current fetchPartition implementation. [#16538](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16538) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Multiple improvements for `RabbitMQ`: Fixed bug for [#16263](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16263). Also minimized event loop lifetime. Added more efficient queues setup. [#16426](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16426) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fix debug assertion in `quantileDeterministic` function. In previous version it may also transfer up to two times more data over the network. Although no bug existed. This fixes [#15683](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15683). [#16410](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16410) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add `TablesToDropQueueSize` metric. It's equal to number of dropped tables, that are waiting for background data removal. [#16364](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16364) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Better diagnostics when client has dropped connection. In previous versions, `Attempt to read after EOF` and `Broken pipe` exceptions were logged in server. In new version, it's information message `Client has dropped the connection, cancel the query.`. [#16329](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16329) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add total_rows/total_bytes (from system.tables) support for Set/Join table engines. [#16306](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16306) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Now it's possible to specify `PRIMARY KEY` without `ORDER BY` for MergeTree table engines family. Closes [#15591](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15591). [#16284](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16284) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* If there is no tmp folder in the system (chroot, misconfigutation etc) `clickhouse-local` will create temporary subfolder in the current directory. [#16280](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16280) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Add support for nested data types (like named tuple) as sub-types. Fixes [#15587](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15587). [#16262](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16262) ([Ivan](https://github.com/abyss7)).
* Support for `database_atomic_wait_for_drop_and_detach_synchronously`/`NO DELAY`/`SYNC` for `DROP DATABASE`. [#16127](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16127) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add `allow_nondeterministic_optimize_skip_unused_shards` (to allow non deterministic like `rand()` or `dictGet()` in sharding key). [#16105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16105) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix `memory_profiler_step`/`max_untracked_memory` for queries via HTTP (test included). Fix the issue that adjusting this value globally in xml config does not help either, since those settings are not applied anyway, only default (4MB) value is [used](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/17731245336d8c84f75e4c0894c5797ed7732190/src/Common/ThreadStatus.h#L104). Fix `query_id` for the most root ThreadStatus of the http query (by initializing QueryScope after reading query_id). [#16101](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16101) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Now it's allowed to execute `ALTER ... ON CLUSTER` queries regardless of the `<internal_replication>` setting in cluster config. [#16075](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16075) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Fix rare issue when `clickhouse-client` may abort on exit due to loading of suggestions. This fixes [#16035](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16035). [#16047](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16047) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add support of `cache` layout for `Redis` dictionaries with complex key. [#15985](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15985) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fix query hang (endless loop) in case of misconfiguration (`connections_with_failover_max_tries` set to 0). [#15876](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15876) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Change level of some log messages from information to debug, so information messages will not appear for every query. This closes [#5293](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5293). [#15816](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15816) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove `MemoryTrackingInBackground*` metrics to avoid potentially misleading results. This fixes [#15684](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15684). [#15813](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15813) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add reconnects to `zookeeper-dump-tree` tool. [#15711](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15711) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow explicitly specify columns list in `CREATE TABLE table AS table_function(...)` query. Fixes [#9249](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9249) Fixes [#14214](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14214). [#14295](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14295) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

#### Performance Improvement

* Do not merge parts across partitions in SELECT FINAL. [#15938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15938) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Improve performance of `-OrNull` and `-OrDefault` aggregate functions. [#16661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16661) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improve performance of `quantileMerge`. In previous versions it was obnoxiously slow. This closes [#1463](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/1463). [#16643](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16643) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improve performance of logical functions a little. [#16347](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16347) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improved performance of merges assignment in MergeTree table engines. Shouldn't be visible for the user. [#16191](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16191) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Speedup hashed/sparse_hashed dictionary loading by preallocating the hash table. [#15454](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15454) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Now trivial count optimization becomes slightly non-trivial. Predicates that contain exact partition expr can be optimized too. This also fixes [#11092](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11092) which returns wrong count when `max_parallel_replicas > 1`. [#15074](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15074) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement

* Add flaky check for stateless tests. It will detect potentially flaky functional tests in advance, before they are merged. [#16238](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16238) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Use proper version for `croaring` instead of amalgamation. [#16285](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16285) ([sundyli](https://github.com/sundy-li)).
* Improve generation of build files for `ya.make` build system (Arcadia). [#16700](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16700) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add MySQL BinLog file check tool for `MaterializeMySQL` database engine. `MaterializeMySQL` is an experimental feature. [#16223](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16223) ([Winter Zhang](https://github.com/zhang2014)).
* Check for executable bit on non-executable files. People often accidentially commit executable files from Windows. [#15843](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15843) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Check for `#pragma once` in headers. [#15818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15818) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix illegal code style `&vector[idx]` in libhdfs3. This fixes libcxx debug build. See also https://github.com/ClickHouse-Extras/libhdfs3/pull/8 . [#15815](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15815) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Fix build of one miscellaneous example tool on Mac OS. Note that we don't build examples on Mac OS in our CI (we build only ClickHouse binary), so there is zero chance it will not break again. This fixes [#15804](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15804). [#15808](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15808) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Simplify Sys/V init script. [#14135](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14135) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added `boost::program_options` to `db_generator` in order to increase its usability. This closes [#15940](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15940). [#15973](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15973) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

### ClickHouse release v20.10.4.1-stable, 2020-11-13

#### Bug Fix

* Fix rare silent crashes when query profiler is on and ClickHouse is installed on OS with glibc version that has (supposedly) broken asynchronous unwind tables for some functions. This fixes [#15301](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15301). This fixes [#13098](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13098). [#16846](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16846) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix `IN` operator over several columns and tuples with enabled `transform_null_in` setting. Fixes [#15310](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15310). [#16722](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16722) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* This will fix optimize_read_in_order/optimize_aggregation_in_order with max_threads>0 and expression in ORDER BY. [#16637](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16637) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Now when parsing AVRO from input the LowCardinality is removed from type. Fixes [#16188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16188). [#16521](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16521) ([Mike](https://github.com/myrrc)).
* Fix rapid growth of metadata when using MySQL Master -> MySQL Slave -> ClickHouse MaterializeMySQL Engine, and `slave_parallel_worker` enabled on MySQL Slave, by properly shrinking GTID sets. This fixes [#15951](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15951). [#16504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16504) ([TCeason](https://github.com/TCeason)).
* Fix DROP TABLE for Distributed (racy with INSERT). [#16409](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16409) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix processing of very large entries in replication queue. Very large entries may appear in ALTER queries if table structure is extremely large (near 1 MB). This fixes [#16307](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16307). [#16332](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16332) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix bug with MySQL database. When MySQL server used as database engine is down some queries raise Exception, because they try to get tables from disabled server, while it's unnecessary. For example, query `SELECT ... FROM system.parts` should work only with MergeTree tables and don't touch MySQL database at all. [#16032](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16032) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Improvement

* Workaround for use S3 with nginx server as proxy. Nginx currenty does not accept urls with empty path like http://domain.com?delete, but vanilla aws-sdk-cpp produces this kind of urls. This commit uses patched aws-sdk-cpp version, which makes urls with "/" as path in this cases, like http://domain.com/?delete. [#16813](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/16813) ([ianton-ru](https://github.com/ianton-ru)).


### ClickHouse release v20.10.3.30, 2020-10-28

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* Make `multiple_joins_rewriter_version` obsolete. Remove first version of joins rewriter. [#15472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15472) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).
* Change default value of `format_regexp_escaping_rule` setting (it's related to `Regexp` format) to `Raw` (it means - read whole subpattern as a value) to make the behaviour more like to what users expect. [#15426](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15426) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add support for nested multiline comments `/* comment /* comment */ */` in SQL. This conforms to the SQL standard. [#14655](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14655) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added MergeTree settings (`max_replicated_merges_with_ttl_in_queue` and `max_number_of_merges_with_ttl_in_pool`) to control the number of merges with TTL in the background pool and replicated queue. This change breaks compatibility with older versions only if you use delete TTL. Otherwise, replication will stay compatible. You can avoid incompatibility issues if you update all shard replicas at once or execute `SYSTEM STOP TTL MERGES` until you finish the update of all replicas. If you'll get an incompatible entry in the replication queue, first of all, execute `SYSTEM STOP TTL MERGES` and after `ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION ...` the partition where incompatible TTL merge was assigned. Attach it back on a single replica. [#14490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14490) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* When upgrading from versions older than 20.5, if rolling update is performed and cluster contains both versions 20.5 or greater and less than 20.5, if ClickHouse nodes with old versions are restarted and old version has been started up in presence of newer versions, it may lead to `Part ... intersects previous part` errors. To prevent this error, first install newer clickhouse-server packages on all cluster nodes and then do restarts (so, when clickhouse-server is restarted, it will start up with the new version).

#### New Feature

* Background data recompression. Add the ability to specify `TTL ... RECOMPRESS codec_name` for MergeTree table engines family. [#14494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14494) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Add parallel quorum inserts. This closes [#15601](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/15601). [#15601](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15601) ([Latysheva Alexandra](https://github.com/alexelex)).
* Settings for additional enforcement of data durability. Useful for non-replicated setups. [#11948](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11948) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* When duplicate block is written to replica where it does not exist locally (has not been fetched from replicas), don't ignore it and write locally to achieve the same effect as if it was successfully replicated. [#11684](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11684) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Now we support `WITH <identifier> AS (subquery) ... ` to introduce named subqueries in the query context. This closes [#2416](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/2416). This closes [#4967](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4967). [#14771](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14771) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Introduce `enable_global_with_statement` setting which propagates the first select's `WITH` statements to other select queries at the same level, and makes aliases in `WITH` statements visible to subqueries. [#15451](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15451) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Secure inter-cluster query execution (with initial_user as current query user). [#13156](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13156) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)). [#15551](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15551) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add the ability to remove column properties and table TTLs. Introduced queries `ALTER TABLE MODIFY COLUMN col_name REMOVE what_to_remove` and `ALTER TABLE REMOVE TTL`. Both operations are lightweight and executed at the metadata level. [#14742](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14742) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

### ClickHouse release v20.9.2.20, 2020-09-22

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* When upgrading from versions older than 20.5, if rolling update is performed and cluster contains both versions 20.5 or greater and less than 20.5, if ClickHouse nodes with old versions are restarted and old version has been started up in presence of newer versions, it may lead to `Part ... intersects previous part` errors. To prevent this error, first install newer clickhouse-server packages on all cluster nodes and then do restarts (so, when clickhouse-server is restarted, it will start up with the new version).

#### New Feature

* Added column transformers `EXCEPT`, `REPLACE`, `APPLY`, which can be applied to the list of selected columns (after `*` or `COLUMNS(...)`). For example, you can write `SELECT * EXCEPT(URL) REPLACE(number + 1 AS number)`. Another example: `select * apply(length) apply(max) from wide_string_table` to find out the maxium length of all string columns. [#14233](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14233) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Added an aggregate function `rankCorr` which computes a rank correlation coefficient.

* Added table function `view` which turns a subquery into a table object. This helps passing queries around. For instance, it can be used in remote/cluster table functions. [#12567](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12567) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

#### Bug Fix

* Fix bug when `ALTER UPDATE` mutation with Nullable column in assignment expression and constant value (like `UPDATE x = 42`) leads to incorrect value in column or segfault. Fixes [#13634](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13634), [#14045](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14045).

### ClickHouse release v20.8.3.18-stable, 2020-09-18

#### Bug Fix

* Fix the issue when some invocations of `extractAllGroups` function may trigger "Memory limit exceeded" error. This fixes [#13383](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13383). [#14889](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14889) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fix rare error in `SELECT` queries when the queried column has `DEFAULT` expression which depends on the other column which also has `DEFAULT` and not present in select query and not exists on disk. Partially fixes [#14531](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14531). [#14845](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14845) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Fixed missed default database name in metadata of materialized view when executing `ALTER ... MODIFY QUERY`. [#14664](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14664) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Fix bug when `ALTER UPDATE` mutation with Nullable column in assignment expression and constant value (like `UPDATE x = 42`) leads to incorrect value in column or segfault. Fixes [#13634](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13634), [#14045](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14045). [#14646](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14646) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Fix wrong Decimal multiplication result caused wrong decimal scale of result column. [#14603](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14603) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).
* Added the checker as neither calling `lc->isNullable()` nor calling `ls->getDictionaryPtr()->isNullable()` would return the correct result. [#14591](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14591) ([myrrc](https://github.com/myrrc)).
* Cleanup data directory after Zookeeper exceptions during CreateQuery for StorageReplicatedMergeTree Engine. [#14563](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14563) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).

### ClickHouse release v20.8.2.3-stable, 2020-09-08

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* Now `OPTIMIZE FINAL` query does not recalculate TTL for parts that were added before TTL was created. Use `ALTER TABLE ... MATERIALIZE TTL` once to calculate them, after that `OPTIMIZE FINAL` will evaluate TTL's properly. This behavior never worked for replicated tables. [#14220](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14220) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Extend `parallel_distributed_insert_select` setting, adding an option to run `INSERT` into local table. The setting changes type from `Bool` to `UInt64`, so the values `false` and `true` are no longer supported. If you have these values in server configuration, the server will not start. Please replace them with `0` and `1`, respectively. [#14060](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14060) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Remove support for the `ODBCDriver` input/output format. This was a deprecated format once used for communication with the ClickHouse ODBC driver, now long superseded by the `ODBCDriver2` format. Resolves [#13629](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13629). [#13847](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13847) ([hexiaoting](https://github.com/hexiaoting)).
* When upgrading from versions older than 20.5, if rolling update is performed and cluster contains both versions 20.5 or greater and less than 20.5, if ClickHouse nodes with old versions are restarted and old version has been started up in presence of newer versions, it may lead to `Part ... intersects previous part` errors. To prevent this error, first install newer clickhouse-server packages on all cluster nodes and then do restarts (so, when clickhouse-server is restarted, it will start up with the new version).

#### New Feature

* Add the ability to specify `Default` compression codec for columns that correspond to settings specified in `config.xml`. Implements: [#9074](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9074). [#14049](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14049) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Support Kerberos authentication in Kafka, using `krb5` and `cyrus-sasl` libraries. [#12771](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12771) ([Ilya Golshtein](https://github.com/ilejn)).
* Add function `normalizeQuery` that replaces literals, sequences of literals and complex aliases with placeholders. Add function `normalizedQueryHash` that returns identical 64bit hash values for similar queries. It helps to analyze query log. This closes [#11271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11271). [#13816](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13816) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add `time_zones` table. [#13880](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13880) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add function `defaultValueOfTypeName` that returns the default value for a given type. [#13877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13877) ([hcz](https://github.com/hczhcz)).
* Add `countDigits(x)` function that count number of decimal digits in integer or decimal column. Add `isDecimalOverflow(d, [p])` function that checks if the value in Decimal column is out of its (or specified) precision. [#14151](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14151) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).
* Add `quantileExactLow` and `quantileExactHigh` implementations with respective aliases for `medianExactLow` and `medianExactHigh`. [#13818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13818) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Added `date_trunc` function that truncates a date/time value to a specified date/time part. [#13888](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13888) ([Vladimir Golovchenko](https://github.com/vladimir-golovchenko)).
* Add new optional section `<user_directories>` to the main config. [#13425](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13425) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Add `ALTER SAMPLE BY` statement that allows to change table sample clause. [#13280](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13280) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Function `position` now supports optional `start_pos` argument. [#13237](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13237) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).

* In previous versions `lcm` function may produce assertion violation in debug build if called with specifically crafted arguments. This fixes [#13368](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13368). [#13510](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13510) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Provide monotonicity for `toDate/toDateTime` functions in more cases. Monotonicity information is used for index analysis (more complex queries will be able to use index). Now the input arguments are saturated more naturally and provides better monotonicity. [#13497](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13497) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Support compound identifiers for custom settings. Custom settings is an integration point of ClickHouse codebase with other codebases (no benefits for ClickHouse itself) [#13496](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13496) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Move parts from DiskLocal to DiskS3 in parallel. `DiskS3` is an experimental feature. [#13459](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13459) ([Pavel Kovalenko](https://github.com/Jokser)).
* Enable mixed granularity parts by default. [#13449](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13449) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Proper remote host checking in S3 redirects (security-related thing). [#13404](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13404) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon)).
* Add `QueryTimeMicroseconds`, `SelectQueryTimeMicroseconds` and `InsertQueryTimeMicroseconds` to system.events. [#13336](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13336) ([ianton-ru](https://github.com/ianton-ru)).
* Fix debug assertion when Decimal has too large negative exponent. Fixes [#13188](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13188). [#13228](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13228) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added cache layer for DiskS3 (cache to local disk mark and index files). `DiskS3` is an experimental feature. [#13076](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13076) ([Pavel Kovalenko](https://github.com/Jokser)).
* Fix readline so it dumps history to file now. [#13600](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13600) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Create `system` database with `Atomic` engine by default (a preparation to enable `Atomic` database engine by default everywhere). [#13680](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13680) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

#### Performance Improvement

* Slightly optimize very short queries with `LowCardinality`. [#14129](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14129) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Enable parallel INSERTs for table engines `Null`, `Memory`, `Distributed` and `Buffer` when the setting `max_insert_threads` is set. [#14120](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14120) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fail fast if `max_rows_to_read` limit is exceeded on parts scan. The motivation behind this change is to skip ranges scan for all selected parts if it is clear that `max_rows_to_read` is already exceeded. The change is quite noticeable for queries over big number of parts. [#13677](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13677) ([Roman Khavronenko](https://github.com/hagen1778)).
* Slightly improve performance of aggregation by UInt8/UInt16 keys. [#13099](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13099) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Optimize `has()`, `indexOf()` and `countEqual()` functions for `Array(LowCardinality(T))` and constant right arguments. [#12550](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12550) ([myrrc](https://github.com/myrrc)).
* When performing trivial `INSERT SELECT` queries, automatically set `max_threads` to 1 or `max_insert_threads`, and set `max_block_size` to `min_insert_block_size_rows`. Related to [#5907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5907). [#12195](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12195) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasFL)).

#### Experimental Feature

* ClickHouse can work as MySQL replica - it is implemented by `MaterializeMySQL` database engine. Implements [#4006](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4006). [#10851](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10851) ([Winter Zhang](https://github.com/zhang2014)).
* Add types `Int128`, `Int256`, `UInt256` and related functions for them. Extend Decimals with Decimal256 (precision up to 76 digits). New types are under the setting `allow_experimental_bigint_types`. It is working extremely slow and bad. The implementation is incomplete. Please don't use this feature. [#13097](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13097) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement

* Added `clickhouse install` script, that is useful if you only have a single binary. [#13528](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13528) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow to run `clickhouse` binary without configuration. [#13515](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13515) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Enable check for typos in code with `codespell`. [#13513](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13513) [#13511](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13511) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Enable Shellcheck in CI as a linter of .sh tests. This closes [#13168](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13168). [#13530](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13530) [#13529](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13529) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a CMake option to fail configuration instead of auto-reconfiguration, enabled by default. [#13687](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13687) ([Konstantin](https://github.com/podshumok)).
* Expose version of embedded tzdata via TZDATA_VERSION in system.build_options. [#13648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13648) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Improve generation of system.time_zones table during build. Closes [#14209](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/14209). [#14215](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14215) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Build ClickHouse with the most fresh tzdata from package repository. [#13623](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13623) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Adding retry logic when bringing up docker-compose cluster; Increasing COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT. [#14112](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/14112) ([vzakaznikov](https://github.com/vzakaznikov)).
* Enabled `system.text_log` in stress test to find more bugs. [#13855](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13855) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Testflows LDAP module: adding missing certificates and dhparam.pem for openldap4. [#13780](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13780) ([vzakaznikov](https://github.com/vzakaznikov)).
* ZooKeeper cannot work reliably in unit tests in CI infrastructure. Using unit tests for ZooKeeper interaction with real ZooKeeper is bad idea from the start (unit tests are not supposed to verify complex distributed systems). We already using integration tests for this purpose and they are better suited. [#13745](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13745) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added docker image for style check. Added style check that all docker and docker compose files are located in docker directory. [#13724](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13724) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).

[#13448](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13448) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).


## ClickHouse release 20.7

### ClickHouse release v20.7.2.30-stable, 2020-08-31

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* Function `modulo` (operator `%`) with at least one floating point number as argument will calculate remainder of division directly on floating point numbers without converting both arguments to integers. It makes behaviour compatible with most of DBMS. This also applicable for Date and DateTime data types. Added alias `mod`. This closes [#7323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7323). [#12585](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12585) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Deprecate special printing of zero Date/DateTime values as `0000-00-00` and `0000-00-00 00:00:00`. [#12442](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12442) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The function `groupArrayMoving*` was not working for distributed queries. It's result was calculated within incorrect data type (without promotion to the largest type). The function `groupArrayMovingAvg` was returning integer number that was inconsistent with the `avg` function. This fixes [#12568](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/12568). [#12622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12622) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add sanity check for MergeTree settings. If the settings are incorrect, the server will refuse to start or to create a table, printing detailed explanation to the user. [#13153](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13153) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Protect from the cases when user may set `background_pool_size` to value lower than `number_of_free_entries_in_pool_to_execute_mutation` or `number_of_free_entries_in_pool_to_lower_max_size_of_merge`. In these cases ALTERs won't work or the maximum size of merge will be too limited. It will throw exception explaining what to do. This closes [#10897](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10897). [#12728](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12728) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* When upgrading from versions older than 20.5, if rolling update is performed and cluster contains both versions 20.5 or greater and less than 20.5, if ClickHouse nodes with old versions are restarted and old version has been started up in presence of newer versions, it may lead to `Part ... intersects previous part` errors. To prevent this error, first install newer clickhouse-server packages on all cluster nodes and then do restarts (so, when clickhouse-server is restarted, it will start up with the new version).

#### New Feature

* Polygon dictionary type that provides efficient "reverse geocoding" lookups - to find the region by coordinates in a dictionary of many polygons (world map). It is using carefully optimized algorithm with recursive grids to maintain low CPU and memory usage. [#9278](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9278) ([achulkov2](https://github.com/achulkov2)).

* Added `system.crash_log` table into which stack traces for fatal errors are collected. This table should be empty. [#12316](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12316) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added http headers `X-ClickHouse-Database` and `X-ClickHouse-Format` which may be used to set default database and output format. [#12981](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12981) ([hcz](https://github.com/hczhcz)).
* Add `minMap` and `maxMap` functions support to `SimpleAggregateFunction`. [#12662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12662) ([Ildus Kurbangaliev](https://github.com/ildus)).
* Add setting `allow_non_metadata_alters` which restricts to execute `ALTER` queries which modify data on disk. Disabled be default. Closes [#11547](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11547). [#12635](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12635) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* A function `formatRow` is added to support turning arbitrary expressions into a string via given format. It's useful for manipulating SQL outputs and is quite versatile combined with the `columns` function. [#12574](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12574) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Add `FROM_UNIXTIME` function for compatibility with MySQL, related to [12149](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/12149). [#12484](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12484) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasFL)).
* Allow Nullable types as keys in MergeTree tables if `allow_nullable_key` table setting is enabled. Closes [#5319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5319). [#12433](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12433) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Integration with [COS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/cos). [#12386](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12386) ([fastio](https://github.com/fastio)).
* Add `mapAdd` and `mapSubtract` functions for adding/subtracting key-mapped values. [#11735](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11735) ([Ildus Kurbangaliev](https://github.com/ildus)).

## ClickHouse release 20.6

### ClickHouse release v20.6.3.28-stable

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* When upgrading from versions older than 20.5, if rolling update is performed and cluster contains both versions 20.5 or greater and less than 20.5, if ClickHouse nodes with old versions are restarted and old version has been started up in presence of newer versions, it may lead to `Part ... intersects previous part` errors. To prevent this error, first install newer clickhouse-server packages on all cluster nodes and then do restarts (so, when clickhouse-server is restarted, it will start up with the new version).

#### New Feature

* Added an initial implementation of `EXPLAIN` query. Syntax: `EXPLAIN SELECT ...`. This fixes [#1118](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/1118). [#11873](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11873) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

* Supported RIGHT and FULL JOIN with `SET join_algorithm = 'partial_merge'`. Only ALL strictness is allowed (ANY, SEMI, ANTI, ASOF are not). [#12118](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12118) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).
* Added a function `initializeAggregation` to initialize an aggregation based on a single value. [#12109](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12109) ([Guillaume Tassery](https://github.com/YiuRULE)).
* Supported `ALTER TABLE ... [ADD|MODIFY] COLUMN ... FIRST` [#4006](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4006). [#12073](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12073) ([Winter Zhang](https://github.com/zhang2014)).
* Added function `parseDateTimeBestEffortUS`. [#12028](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12028) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasFL)).
* Support format `ORC` for output (was supported only for input). [#11662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11662) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar)).

#### Bug Fix

* Fixed `aggregate function any(x) is found inside another aggregate function in query` error with `SET optimize_move_functions_out_of_any = 1` and aliases inside `any()`. [#13419](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13419) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).
* Fixed `PrettyCompactMonoBlock` for clickhouse-local. Fixed extremes/totals with `PrettyCompactMonoBlock`. This fixes [#7746](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7746). [#13394](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13394) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

* The server may crash if user passed specifically crafted arguments to the function `h3ToChildren`. This fixes [#13275](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/13275). [#13277](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13277) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fixed potentially low performance and slightly incorrect result for `uniqExact`, `topK`, `sumDistinct` and similar aggregate functions called on Float types with NaN values. It also triggered assert in debug build. This fixes [#12491](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/12491). [#13254](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13254) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

Fixes [#12406](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/12406). [#13081](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13081) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fixed error `Cannot convert column because it is constant but values of constants are different in source and result` for remote queries which use deterministic functions in scope of query, but not deterministic between queries, like `now()`, `now64()`, `randConstant()`. Fixes [#11327](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11327). [#13075](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/13075) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

* Fixed rare bug when `ALTER DELETE` and `ALTER MODIFY COLUMN` queries executed simultaneously as a single mutation. Bug leads to an incorrect amount of rows in `count.txt` and as a consequence incorrect data in part. Also, fix a small bug with simultaneous `ALTER RENAME COLUMN` and `ALTER ADD COLUMN`. [#12760](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12760) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Fixed `CAST(Nullable(String), Enum())`. [#12745](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12745) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fixed a performance with large tuples, which are interpreted as functions in `IN` section. The case when user write `WHERE x IN tuple(1, 2, ...)` instead of `WHERE x IN (1, 2, ...)` for some obscure reason. [#12700](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12700) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fixed memory tracking for `input_format_parallel_parsing` (by attaching thread to group). [#12672](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12672) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### Experimental Feature
* Added new in-memory format of parts in `MergeTree`-family tables, which stores data in memory. Parts are written on disk at first merge. Part will be created in in-memory format if its size in rows or bytes is below thresholds `min_rows_for_compact_part` and `min_bytes_for_compact_part`. Also optional support of Write-Ahead-Log is available, which is enabled by default and is controlled by setting `in_memory_parts_enable_wal`.

* Add `UNBUNDLED` flag to `system.build_options` table. Move skip lists for `clickhouse-test` to clickhouse repo. [#12107](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12107) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Regular check by [Anchore Container Analysis](https://docs.anchore.com) security analysis tool that looks for [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) in `clickhouse-server` Docker image. Also confirms that `Dockerfile` is buildable. Runs daily on `master` and on pull-requests to `Dockerfile`. [#12102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12102) ([Ivan Blinkov](https://github.com/blinkov)).
* Daily check by [GitHub CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql) security analysis tool that looks for [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/). [#12101](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/12101) ([Ivan Blinkov](https://github.com/blinkov)).

### ClickHouse release v20.5.2.7-stable 2020-07-02

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* Return non-Nullable result from COUNT(DISTINCT), and `uniq` aggregate functions family. If all passed values are NULL, return zero instead. This improves SQL compatibility. [#11661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11661) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added a check for the case when user-level setting is specified in a wrong place. User-level settings should be specified in `users.xml` inside `<profile>` section for specific user profile (or in `<default>` for default settings). The server won't start with exception message in log. This fixes [#9051](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9051). If you want to skip the check, you can either move settings to the appropriate place or add `<skip_check_for_incorrect_settings>1</skip_check_for_incorrect_settings>` to config.xml. [#11449](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11449) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The setting `input_format_with_names_use_header` is enabled by default. It will affect parsing of input formats `-WithNames` and `-WithNamesAndTypes`. [#10937](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10937) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove `experimental_use_processors` setting. It is enabled by default. [#10924](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10924) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Update `zstd` to 1.4.4. It has some minor improvements in performance and compression ratio. If you run replicas with different versions of ClickHouse you may see reasonable error messages `Data after merge is not byte-identical to data on another replicas.` with explanation. These messages are Ok and you should not worry. This change is backward compatible but we list it here in changelog in case you will wonder about these messages. [#10663](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10663) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added a check for meaningless codecs and a setting `allow_suspicious_codecs` to control this check. This closes [#4966](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4966). [#10645](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10645) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Several Kafka setting changes their defaults. See [#11388](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11388).
* When upgrading from versions older than 20.5, if rolling update is performed and cluster contains both versions 20.5 or greater and less than 20.5, if ClickHouse nodes with old versions are restarted and old version has been started up in presence of newer versions, it may lead to `Part ... intersects previous part` errors. To prevent this error, first install newer clickhouse-server packages on all cluster nodes and then do restarts (so, when clickhouse-server is restarted, it will start up with the new version).

#### New Feature

* `TTL DELETE WHERE` and `TTL GROUP BY` for automatic data coarsening and rollup in tables. [#10537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10537) ([expl0si0nn](https://github.com/expl0si0nn)).

* Added system tables for users, roles, grants, settings profiles, quotas, row policies; added commands SHOW USER, SHOW [CURRENT|ENABLED] ROLES, SHOW SETTINGS PROFILES. [#10387](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10387) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support writes in ODBC Table function [#10554](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10554) ([ageraab](https://github.com/ageraab)). [#10901](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10901) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Add query performance metrics based on Linux `perf_events` (these metrics are calculated with hardware CPU counters and OS counters). It is optional and requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` to be set on clickhouse binary. [#9545](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9545) [Andrey Skobtsov](https://github.com/And42). [#11226](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11226) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm)).
* Now support `NULL` and `NOT NULL` modifiers for data types in `CREATE` query. [#11057](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11057) ([Павел Потемкин](https://github.com/Potya)).
* Add `ArrowStream` input and output format. [#11088](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11088) ([hcz](https://github.com/hczhcz)).
* Support Cassandra as external dictionary source. [#4978](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/4978) ([favstovol](https://github.com/favstovol)).
* Added a new layout `direct` which loads all the data directly from the source for each query, without storing or caching data. [#10622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10622) ([Artem Streltsov](https://github.com/kekekekule)).

* If data skipping index is dependent on columns that are going to be modified during background merge (for SummingMergeTree, AggregatingMergeTree as well as for TTL GROUP BY), it was calculated incorrectly. This issue is fixed by moving index calculation after merge so the index is calculated on merged data. [#11162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11162) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

* Fix incompatibility of two-level aggregation between versions 20.1 and earlier. This incompatibility happens when different versions of ClickHouse are used on initiator node and remote nodes and the size of GROUP BY result is large and aggregation is performed by a single String field. It leads to several unmerged rows for a single key in result. [#10952](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10952) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fix possible race which could happen when you get result from aggregate function state from multiple thread for the same column. The only way (which I found) it can happen is when you use `finalizeAggregation` function while reading from table with `Memory` engine which stores `AggregateFunction` state for `quanite*` function. [#10890](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10890) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

* Fix predicates optimization for distributed queries (`enable_optimize_predicate_expression=1`) for queries with `HAVING` section (i.e. when filtering on the server initiator is required), by preserving the order of expressions (and this is enough to fix), and also force aggregator use column names over indexes. Fixes: [#10613](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10613), [#11413](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11413). [#10621](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10621) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

[#10486](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10486) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fixed error with "max_rows_to_sort" limit. [#10268](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10268) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Improvement

* Apply `TTL` for old data, after `ALTER MODIFY TTL` query. This behaviour is controlled by setting `materialize_ttl_after_modify`, which is enabled by default. [#11042](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11042) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* When parsing C-style backslash escapes in string literals, VALUES and various text formats (this is an extension to SQL standard that is endemic for ClickHouse and MySQL), keep backslash if unknown escape sequence is found (e.g. `\%` or `\w`) that will make usage of `LIKE` and `match` regular expressions more convenient (it's enough to write `name LIKE 'used\_cars'` instead of `name LIKE 'used\\_cars'`) and more compatible at the same time. This fixes [#10922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10922). [#11208](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11208) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* When reading Decimal value, cut extra digits after point. This behaviour is more compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. This fixes [#10202](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10202). [#11831](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11831) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow to DROP replicated table if the metadata in ZooKeeper was already removed and does not exist (this is also the case when using TestKeeper for testing and the server was restarted). Allow to RENAME replicated table even if there is an error communicating with ZooKeeper. This fixes [#10720](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10720). [#11652](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11652) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Slightly improve diagnostic of reading decimal from string. This closes [#10202](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10202). [#11829](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11829) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix sleep invocation in signal handler. It was sleeping for less amount of time than expected. [#11825](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11825) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* (Only Linux) OS related performance metrics (for CPU and I/O) will work even without `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability. [#10544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10544) ([Alexander Kazakov](https://github.com/Akazz)).
* Added `hostname` as an alias to function `hostName`. This feature was suggested by Victor Tarnavskiy from Yandex.Metrica. [#11821](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11821) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added support for distributed `DDL` (update/delete/drop partition) on cross replication clusters. [#11703](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11703) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Emit warning instead of error in server log at startup if we cannot listen one of the listen addresses (e.g. IPv6 is unavailable inside Docker). Note that if server fails to listen all listed addresses, it will refuse to startup as before. This fixes [#4406](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4406). [#11687](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11687) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Default user and database creation on docker image starting. [#10637](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10637) ([Paramtamtam](https://github.com/tarampampam)).
* When multiline query is printed to server log, the lines are joined. Make it to work correct in case of multiline string literals, identifiers and single-line comments. This fixes [#3853](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/3853). [#11686](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11686) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Add support for distributed DDL (`UPDATE/DELETE/DROP PARTITION`) on cross replication clusters. [#11508](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11508) ([frank lee](https://github.com/etah000)).
* Clear password from command line in `clickhouse-client` and `clickhouse-benchmark` if the user has specified it with explicit value. This prevents password exposure by `ps` and similar tools. [#11665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11665) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Don't use debug info from ELF file if it does not correspond to the running binary. It is needed to avoid printing wrong function names and source locations in stack traces. This fixes [#7514](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7514). [#11657](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11657) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Return NULL/zero when value is not parsed completely in parseDateTimeBestEffortOrNull/Zero functions. This fixes [#7876](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7876). [#11653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11653) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Skip empty parameters in requested URL. They may appear when you write `http://localhost:8123/?&a=b` or `http://localhost:8123/?a=b&&c=d`. This closes [#10749](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10749). [#11651](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11651) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Allow comparison with constant strings by implicit conversions when analysing index conditions on other types. This may close [#11630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11630). [#11648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11648) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7572#issuecomment-642815377 Support config default HTTPHandlers. [#11628](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11628) ([Winter Zhang](https://github.com/zhang2014)).
* Make more input formats to work with Kafka engine. Fix the issue with premature flushes. Fix the performance issue when `kafka_num_consumers` is greater than number of partitions in topic. [#11599](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11599) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Improve `multiple_joins_rewriter_version=2` logic. Fix unknown columns error for lambda aliases. [#11587](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11587) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).
* Better exception message when cannot parse columns declaration list. This closes [#10403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10403). [#11537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11537) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Improve `enable_optimize_predicate_expression=1` logic for VIEW. [#11513](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11513) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).
* Adding support for PREWHERE in live view tables. [#11495](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11495) ([vzakaznikov](https://github.com/vzakaznikov)).
* Automatically update DNS cache, which is used to check if user is allowed to connect from an address. [#11487](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11487) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* OPTIMIZE FINAL will force merge even if concurrent merges are performed. This closes [#11309](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11309) and closes [#11322](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11322). [#11346](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11346) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Suppress output of cancelled queries in clickhouse-client. In previous versions result may continue to print in terminal even after you press Ctrl+C to cancel query. This closes [#9473](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9473). [#11342](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11342) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Add's a `hasSubstr` function that allows for look for subsequences in arrays. Note: this function is likely to be renamed without further notice. [#11071](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11071) ([Ryad Zenine](https://github.com/r-zenine)).
* Added OpenCL support and bitonic sort algorithm, which can be used for sorting integer types of data in single column. Needs to be build with flag `-DENABLE_OPENCL=1`. For using bitonic sort algorithm instead of others you need to set `bitonic_sort` for Setting's option `special_sort` and make sure that OpenCL is available. This feature does not improve performance or anything else, it is only provided as an example and for demonstration purposes. It is likely to be removed in near future if there will be no further development in this direction. [#10232](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10232) ([Ri](https://github.com/margaritiko)).

* Fix memory leak when exception is thrown in the middle of aggregation with -State functions. This fixes [#8995](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8995). [#11496](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11496) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* If data skipping index is dependent on columns that are going to be modified during background merge (for SummingMergeTree, AggregatingMergeTree as well as for TTL GROUP BY), it was calculated incorrectly. This issue is fixed by moving index calculation after merge so the index is calculated on merged data. [#11162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11162) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

* Fix predicates optimization for distributed queries (`enable_optimize_predicate_expression=1`) for queries with `HAVING` section (i.e. when filtering on the server initiator is required), by preserving the order of expressions (and this is enough to fix), and also force aggregator use column names over indexes. Fixes: [#10613](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10613), [#11413](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11413). [#10621](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10621) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

* Fixed possible race which could happen when you get result from aggregate function state from multiple thread for the same column. The only way it can happen is when you use `finalizeAggregation` function while reading from table with `Memory` engine which stores `AggregateFunction` state for `quantile*` function. [#10890](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10890) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

### ClickHouse release v20.4.2.9, 2020-05-12

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* System tables (e.g. system.query_log, system.trace_log, system.metric_log) are using compact data part format for parts smaller than 10 MiB in size. Compact data part format is supported since version 20.3. If you are going to downgrade to version less than 20.3, you should manually delete table data for system logs in `/var/lib/clickhouse/data/system/`.
* When string comparison involves FixedString and compared arguments are of different sizes, do comparison as if smaller string is padded to the length of the larger. This is intented for SQL compatibility if we imagine that FixedString data type corresponds to SQL CHAR. This closes [#9272](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9272). [#10363](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10363) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Make SHOW CREATE TABLE multiline. Now it is more readable and more like MySQL. [#10049](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10049) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))
* Added a setting `validate_polygons` that is used in `pointInPolygon` function and enabled by default. [#9857](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9857) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))

#### New Feature
* Add support for secured connection from ClickHouse to Zookeeper [#10184](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10184) ([Konstantin Lebedev](https://github.com/xzkostyan))
* Support custom HTTP handlers. See [#5436](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5436) for description. [#7572](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7572) ([Winter Zhang](https://github.com/zhang2014))
* Add MessagePack Input/Output format. [#9889](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9889) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar))
* Add Regexp input format. [#9196](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9196) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar))
* Added output format `Markdown` for embedding tables in markdown documents. [#10317](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10317) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar))
* Added support for custom settings section in dictionaries. Also fixes issue [#2829](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/2829). [#10137](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10137) ([Artem Streltsov](https://github.com/kekekekule))
* Added custom settings support in DDL-queries for `CREATE DICTIONARY` [#10465](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10465) ([Artem Streltsov](https://github.com/kekekekule))
* Add simple server-wide memory profiler that will collect allocation contexts when server memory usage becomes higher than the next allocation threshold. [#10444](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10444) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Add setting `always_fetch_merged_part` which restrict replica to merge parts by itself and always prefer dowloading from other replicas. [#10379](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10379) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Add function `JSONExtractKeysAndValuesRaw` which extracts raw data from JSON objects [#10378](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10378) ([hcz](https://github.com/hczhcz))
* Add memory usage from OS to `system.asynchronous_metrics`. [#10361](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10361) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Added generic variants for functions `least` and `greatest`. Now they work with arbitrary number of arguments of arbitrary types. This fixes [#4767](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4767) [#10318](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10318) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Now ClickHouse controls timeouts of dictionary sources on its side.

* If data skipping index is dependent on columns that are going to be modified during background merge (for SummingMergeTree, AggregatingMergeTree as well as for TTL GROUP BY), it was calculated incorrectly. This issue is fixed by moving index calculation after merge so the index is calculated on merged data. [#11162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11162) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix excessive reserving of threads for simple queries (optimization for reducing the number of threads, which was partly broken after changes in pipeline). [#11114](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11114) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix predicates optimization for distributed queries (`enable_optimize_predicate_expression=1`) for queries with `HAVING` section (i.e. when filtering on the server initiator is required), by preserving the order of expressions (and this is enough to fix), and also force aggregator use column names over indexes. Fixes: [#10613](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/10613), [#11413](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11413). [#10621](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10621) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Introduce commit retry logic to decrease the possibility of getting duplicates from Kafka in rare cases when offset commit was failed. [#9884](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9884) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).

#### Performance Improvement

* Get dictionary and check access rights only once per each call of any function reading external dictionaries. [#10928](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10928) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement

* Fix several flaky integration tests. [#11355](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/11355) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

### ClickHouse release v20.3.5.21, 2020-03-27

#### Bug Fix

* Fix 'Different expressions with the same alias' error when query has PREWHERE and WHERE on distributed table and `SET distributed_product_mode = 'local'`. [#9871](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9871) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).
* Fix mutations excessive memory consumption for tables with a composite primary key. This fixes [#9850](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9850). [#9860](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9860) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* For INSERT queries shard now clamps the settings got from the initiator to the shard's constaints instead of throwing an exception. This fix allows to send INSERT queries to a shard with another constraints. This change improves fix [#9447](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9447). [#9852](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9852) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Fix 'COMMA to CROSS JOIN rewriter is not enabled or cannot rewrite query' error in case of subqueries with COMMA JOIN out of tables lists (i.e. in WHERE). Fixes [#9782](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9782). [#9830](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9830) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).

Also add check that the order of rows in mutation is ordered in sorting key order and this order is not violated. [#9886](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9886) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).


### ClickHouse release v20.3.4.10, 2020-03-20

#### Bug Fix
* This release also contains all bug fixes from 20.1.8.41
* Fix missing `rows_before_limit_at_least` for queries over http (with processors pipeline). This fixes [#9730](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9730). [#9757](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9757) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai))


### ClickHouse release v20.3.3.6, 2020-03-17

#### Bug Fix
* This release also contains all bug fixes from 20.1.7.38
* Fix bug in a replication that does not allow replication to work if the user has executed mutations on the previous version. This fixes [#9645](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9645). [#9652](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9652) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)). It makes version 20.3 backward compatible again.
* Add setting `use_compact_format_in_distributed_parts_names` which allows to write files for `INSERT` queries into `Distributed` table with more compact format. This fixes [#9647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9647). [#9653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9653) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)). It makes version 20.3 backward compatible again.

### ClickHouse release v20.3.2.1, 2020-03-12

#### Backward Incompatible Change

* Fixed the issue `file name too long` when sending data for `Distributed` tables for a large number of replicas. Fixed the issue that replica credentials were exposed in the server log. The format of directory name on disk was changed to `[shard{shard_index}[_replica{replica_index}]]`. [#8911](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8911) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb)) After you upgrade to the new version, you will not be able to downgrade without manual intervention, because old server version does not recognize the new directory format. If you want to downgrade, you have to manually rename the corresponding directories to the old format. This change is relevant only if you have used asynchronous `INSERT`s to `Distributed` tables. In the version 20.3.3 we will introduce a setting that will allow you to enable the new format gradually.
* Changed the format of replication log entries for mutation commands. You have to wait for old mutations to process before installing the new version.
* Implement simple memory profiler that dumps stacktraces to `system.trace_log` every N bytes over soft allocation limit [#8765](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8765) ([Ivan](https://github.com/abyss7)) [#9472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9472) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)) The column of `system.trace_log` was renamed from `timer_type` to `trace_type`. This will require changes in third-party performance analysis and flamegraph processing tools.
* Use OS thread id everywhere instead of internal thread number. This fixes [#7477](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7477) Old `clickhouse-client` cannot receive logs that are send from the server when the setting `send_logs_level` is enabled, because the names and types of the structured log messages were changed. On the other hand, different server versions can send logs with different types to each other. When you don't use the `send_logs_level` setting, you should not care. [#8954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8954) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Remove `indexHint` function [#9542](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9542) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Remove `findClusterIndex`, `findClusterValue` functions. This fixes [#8641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8641). If you were using these functions, send an email to `clickhouse-feedback@yandex-team.com` [#9543](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9543) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Now it's not allowed to create columns or add columns with `SELECT` subquery as default expression. [#9481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9481) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Require aliases for subqueries in JOIN. [#9274](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9274) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Improved `ALTER MODIFY/ADD` queries logic. Now you cannot `ADD` column without type, `MODIFY` default expression does not change type of column and `MODIFY` type does not loose default expression value. Fixes [#8669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8669). [#9227](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9227) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Require server to be restarted to apply the changes in logging configuration. This is a temporary workaround to avoid the bug where the server logs to a deleted log file (see [#8696](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8696)). [#8707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8707) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm))
* The setting `experimental_use_processors` is enabled by default. This setting enables usage of the new query pipeline. This is internal refactoring and we expect no visible changes. If you will see any issues, set it to back zero. [#8768](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8768) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))

#### New Feature
* Add `Avro` and `AvroConfluent` input/output formats [#8571](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8571) ([Andrew Onyshchuk](https://github.com/oandrew)) [#8957](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8957) ([Andrew Onyshchuk](https://github.com/oandrew)) [#8717](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8717) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Multi-threaded and non-blocking updates of expired keys in `cache` dictionaries (with optional permission to read old ones). [#8303](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8303) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov))
* Add query `ALTER ... MATERIALIZE TTL`. It runs mutation that forces to remove expired data by TTL and recalculates meta-information about TTL in all parts. [#8775](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8775) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))
* Switch from HashJoin to MergeJoin (on disk) if needed [#9082](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9082) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))

* `JSONEachRowFormat`: support special case when objects enclosed in top-level array. [#8860](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8860) ([Kruglov Pavel](https://github.com/Avogar))
* Now it's possible to create a column with `DEFAULT` expression which depends on a column with default `ALIAS` expression. [#9489](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9489) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Allow to specify `--limit` more than the source data size in `clickhouse-obfuscator`. The data will repeat itself with different random seed. [#9155](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9155) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Added `groupArraySample` function (similar to `groupArray`) with reservior sampling algorithm. [#8286](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8286) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird))
* Now you can monitor the size of update queue in `cache`/`complex_key_cache` dictionaries via system metrics. [#9413](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9413) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov))
* Allow to use CRLF as a line separator in CSV output format with setting `output_format_csv_crlf_end_of_line` is set to 1 [#8934](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8934) [#8935](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8935) [#8963](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8963) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb))
* Implement more functions of the [H3](https://github.com/uber/h3) API: `h3GetBaseCell`, `h3HexAreaM2`, `h3IndexesAreNeighbors`, `h3ToChildren`, `h3ToString` and `stringToH3` [#8938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8938) ([Nico Mandery](https://github.com/nmandery))
* New setting introduced: `max_parser_depth` to control maximum stack size and allow large complex queries. This fixes [#6681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6681) and [#7668](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7668). [#8647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8647) ([Maxim Smirnov](https://github.com/qMBQx8GH))
* Add a setting `force_optimize_skip_unused_shards` setting to throw if skipping of unused shards is not possible [#8805](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8805) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))
* Allow to configure multiple disks/volumes for storing data for send in `Distributed` engine [#8756](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8756) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))
* Support storage policy (`<tmp_policy>`) for storing temporary data. [#8750](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8750) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))
* Added `X-ClickHouse-Exception-Code` HTTP header that is set if exception was thrown before sending data. This implements [#4971](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/4971). [#8786](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8786) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb))
* Added function `ifNotFinite`. It is just a syntactic sugar: `ifNotFinite(x, y) = isFinite(x) ? x : y`. [#8710](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8710) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Added `last_successful_update_time` column in `system.dictionaries` table [#9394](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9394) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov))

* Added system tables `system.zeros` and `system.zeros_mt` as well as tale functions `zeros()` and `zeros_mt()`. Tables (and table functions) contain single column with name `zero` and type `UInt8`. This column contains zeros. It is needed for test purposes as the fastest method to generate many rows. This fixes [#6604](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6604) [#9593](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9593) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai))

#### Experimental Feature
* Add new compact format of parts in `MergeTree`-family tables in which all columns are stored in one file. It helps to increase performance of small and frequent inserts. The old format (one file per column) is now called wide. Data storing format is controlled by settings `min_bytes_for_wide_part` and `min_rows_for_wide_part`. [#8290](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8290) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))

* For how the default disk calculates the free space from `data` subdirectory. Fixed the issue when the amount of free space is not calculated correctly if the `data` directory is mounted to a separate device (rare case). This fixes [#7441](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7441) [#9257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9257) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb))

* Added range check to function `h3EdgeLengthM`. Without this check, buffer overflow is possible. [#8945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8945) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Fixed up a bug in batched calculations of ternary logical OPs on multiple arguments (more than 10). [#8718](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8718) ([Alexander Kazakov](https://github.com/Akazz))
* Fix error of PREWHERE optimization, which could lead to segfaults or `Inconsistent number of columns got from MergeTreeRangeReader` exception. [#9024](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9024) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))
* Fix unexpected `Timeout exceeded while reading from socket` exception, which randomly happens on secure connection before timeout actually exceeded and when query profiler is enabled. Also add `connect_timeout_with_failover_secure_ms` settings (default 100ms), which is similar to `connect_timeout_with_failover_ms`, but is used for secure connections (because SSL handshake is slower, than ordinary TCP connection) [#9026](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9026) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix))
* Fix bug with mutations finalization, when mutation may hang in state with `parts_to_do=0` and `is_done=0`. [#9022](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9022) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Use new ANY JOIN logic with `partial_merge_join` setting. It's possible to make `ANY|ALL|SEMI LEFT` and `ALL INNER` joins with `partial_merge_join=1` now. [#8932](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8932) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Shard now clamps the settings got from the initiator to the shard's constaints instead of throwing an exception. This fix allows to send queries to a shard with another constraints. [#9447](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9447) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar))
* Fixed memory management problem in `MergeTreeReadPool`. [#8791](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8791) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon))
* Fix `toDecimal*OrNull()` functions family when called with string `e`. Fixes [#8312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8312) [#8764](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8764) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Make sure that `FORMAT Null` sends no data to the client. [#8767](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8767) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm))
* Fix bug that timestamp in `LiveViewBlockInputStream` will not updated. `LIVE VIEW` is an experimental feature. [#8644](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8644) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider)) [#8625](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8625) ([vxider](https://github.com/Vxider))

* Fixed UBSan report in MergeTreeIndexSet. This fixes [#9250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9250) [#9365](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9365) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Fixed the behaviour of `match` and `extract` functions when haystack has zero bytes. The behaviour was wrong when haystack was constant. This fixes [#9160](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9160) [#9163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9163) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)) [#9345](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9345) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))

[#9016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9016) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)) Fix data type ids in `T64` compression codec that leads to wrong (de)compression in affected versions. [#9033](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9033) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Add setting `enable_early_constant_folding` and disable it in some cases that leads to errors. [#9010](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9010) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Fix pushdown predicate optimizer with VIEW and enable the test [#9011](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9011) ([Winter Zhang](https://github.com/zhang2014))
* Fix segfault in `Merge` tables, that can happen when reading from `File` storages [#9387](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9387) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix))
* Added a check for storage policy in `ATTACH PARTITION FROM`, `REPLACE PARTITION`, `MOVE TO TABLE`. Otherwise it could make data of part inaccessible after restart and prevent ClickHouse to start. [#9383](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9383) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon))
* Fix alters if there is TTL set for table. [#8800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8800) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))

This fixes [#9491](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9491), closes [#9492](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9492) [#9500](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9500) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Prevent losing data in `Kafka` in rare cases when exception happens after reading suffix but before commit. Fixes [#9378](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9378) [#9507](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9507) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov))
* Fixed exception in `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` [#8663](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8663) ([Nikita Vasilev](https://github.com/nikvas0))
* Fix crash when a user tries to `ALTER MODIFY SETTING` for old-formated `MergeTree` table engines family. [#9435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9435) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Support for UInt64 numbers that don't fit in Int64 in JSON-related functions. Update SIMDJSON to master. This fixes [#9209](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9209) [#9344](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9344) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Fixed execution of inversed predicates when non-strictly monotinic functional index is used. [#9223](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9223) ([Alexander Kazakov](https://github.com/Akazz))
* Don't try to fold `IN` constant in `GROUP BY` [#8868](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8868) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird))
* Fix bug in `ALTER DELETE` mutations which leads to index corruption. This fixes [#9019](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9019) and [#8982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8982). Additionally fix extremely rare race conditions in `ReplicatedMergeTree` `ALTER` queries. [#9048](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9048) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* When the setting `compile_expressions` is enabled, you can get `unexpected column` in `LLVMExecutableFunction` when we use `Nullable` type [#8910](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8910) ([Guillaume Tassery](https://github.com/YiuRULE))
* Multiple fixes for `Kafka` engine: 1) fix duplicates that were appearing during consumer group rebalance. 2) Fix rare 'holes' appeared when data were polled from several partitions with one poll and committed partially (now we always process / commit the whole polled block of messages). 3) Fix flushes by block size (before that only flushing by timeout was working properly). 4) better subscription procedure (with assignment feedback). 5) Make tests work faster (with default intervals and timeouts). Due to the fact that data was not flushed by block size before (as it should according to documentation), that PR may lead to some performance degradation with default settings (due to more often & tinier flushes which are less optimal). If you encounter the performance issue after that change - please increase `kafka_max_block_size` in the table to the bigger value ( for example `CREATE TABLE ...Engine=Kafka ... SETTINGS ... kafka_max_block_size=524288`). Fixes [#7259](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7259) [#8917](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8917) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov))

* Allow `interval` identifier to correctly parse without backticks. Fixed issue when a query cannot be executed even if the `interval` identifier is enclosed in backticks or double quotes. This fixes [#9124](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9124). [#9142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9142) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Fixed fuzz test and incorrect behaviour of `bitTestAll`/`bitTestAny` functions. [#9143](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9143) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Fix possible crash/wrong number of rows in `LIMIT n WITH TIES` when there are a lot of rows equal to n'th row. [#9464](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9464) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix))

#### Improvement
* Implement `ALTER MODIFY/DROP` queries on top of mutations for `ReplicatedMergeTree*` engines family. Now `ALTERS` blocks only at the metadata update stage, and don't block after that. [#8701](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8701) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Add ability to rewrite CROSS to INNER JOINs with `WHERE` section containing unqialified names. [#9512](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9512) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Make `SHOW TABLES` and `SHOW DATABASES` queries support the `WHERE` expressions and `FROM`/`IN` [#9076](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9076) ([sundyli](https://github.com/sundy-li))
* Added a setting `deduplicate_blocks_in_dependent_materialized_views`. [#9070](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9070) ([urykhy](https://github.com/urykhy))
* After recent changes MySQL client started to print binary strings in hex thereby making them not readable ([#9032](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9032)). The workaround in ClickHouse is to mark string columns as UTF-8, which is not always, but usually the case. [#9079](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9079) ([Yuriy Baranov](https://github.com/yurriy))
* Add support of String and FixedString keys for `sumMap` [#8903](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8903) ([Baudouin Giard](https://github.com/bgiard))
* Support string keys in SummingMergeTree maps [#8933](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8933) ([Baudouin Giard](https://github.com/bgiard))

* The table `system.table_engines` now provides information about feature support (like `supports_ttl` or `supports_sort_order`). [#8830](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8830) ([Max Akhmedov](https://github.com/zlobober))
* Enable `system.metric_log` by default. It will contain rows with values of ProfileEvents, CurrentMetrics collected with "collect_interval_milliseconds" interval (one second by default). The table is very small (usually in order of megabytes) and collecting this data by default is reasonable. [#9225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9225) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Initialize query profiler for all threads in a group, e.g. it allows to fully profile insert-queries. Fixes [#6964](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6964) [#8874](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8874) ([Ivan](https://github.com/abyss7))
* Now temporary `LIVE VIEW` is created by `CREATE LIVE VIEW name WITH TIMEOUT [42] ...` instead of `CREATE TEMPORARY LIVE VIEW ...`, because the previous syntax was not consistent with `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ...` [#9131](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9131) ([tavplubix](https://github.com/tavplubix))
* Add text_log.level configuration parameter to limit entries that goes to `system.text_log` table [#8809](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8809) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))

* For external MySQL dictionaries, allow to mutualize MySQL connection pool to "share" them among dictionaries. This option significantly reduces the number of connections to MySQL servers. [#9409](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9409) ([Clément Rodriguez](https://github.com/clemrodriguez))
* Show nearest query execution time for quantiles in `clickhouse-benchmark` output instead of interpolated values. It's better to show values that correspond to the execution time of some queries. [#8712](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8712) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Possibility to add key & timestamp for the message when inserting data to Kafka. Fixes [#7198](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7198) [#8969](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8969) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov))

* Allow constant functions and constant arrays to be used on the right side of IN operator. [#8813](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8813) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))
* If zookeeper exception has happened while fetching data for system.replicas, display it in a separate column. This implements [#9137](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9137) [#9138](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9138) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Atomically remove MergeTree data parts on destroy. [#8402](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8402) ([Vladimir Chebotarev](https://github.com/excitoon))

* Added names of clusters to suggestions in interactive mode in `clickhouse-client`. [#8709](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8709) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Initialize query profiler for all threads in a group, e.g. it allows to fully profile insert-queries [#8820](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8820) ([Ivan](https://github.com/abyss7))
* Added column `exception_code` in `system.query_log` table. [#8770](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8770) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb))
* Enabled MySQL compatibility server on port `9004` in the default server configuration file. Fixed password generation command in the example in configuration. [#8771](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8771) ([Yuriy Baranov](https://github.com/yurriy))
* Prevent abort on shutdown if the filesystem is readonly. This fixes [#9094](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9094) [#9100](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9100) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))

* Fix progress over native client-server protocol, by send progress after final update (like logs). This may be relevant only to some third-party tools that are using native protocol. [#9495](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9495) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat))
* Add a system metric tracking the number of client connections using MySQL protocol ([#9013](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9013)). [#9015](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9015) ([Eugene Klimov](https://github.com/Slach))

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement

* Fix unit test `collapsing_sorted_stream`. [#9367](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9367) ([Deleted user](https://github.com/ghost)).

### ClickHouse release v20.1.9.54, 2020-03-28

#### Bug Fix

* Fix `'Different expressions with the same alias'` error when query has `PREWHERE` and `WHERE` on distributed table and `SET distributed_product_mode = 'local'`. [#9871](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9871) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2)).

* For INSERT queries shard now clamps the settings got from the initiator to the shard's constaints instead of throwing an exception. This fix allows to send `INSERT` queries to a shard with another constraints. This change improves fix [#9447](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9447). [#9852](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9852) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Fix possible exception `Got 0 in totals chunk, expected 1` on client. It happened for queries with `JOIN` in case if right joined table had zero rows. Example: `select * from system.one t1 join system.one t2 on t1.dummy = t2.dummy limit 0 FORMAT TabSeparated;`. Fixes [#9777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9777). [#9823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9823) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

* Fixed a few cases when timezone of the function argument wasn't used properly. [#9574](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9574) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk)).

#### Improvement

* Remove `ORDER BY` stage from mutations because we read from a single ordered part in a single thread. Also add check that the order of rows in mutation is ordered in sorting key order and this order is not violated. [#9886](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9886) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement

* Clean up duplicated linker flags. Make sure the linker won't look up an unexpected symbol. [#9433](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9433) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

* Fix possible mismatched checksums with column TTLs. [#9451](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9451) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ))
* Fix crash when a user tries to `ALTER MODIFY SETTING` for old-formated `MergeTree` table engines family. [#9435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9435) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Now we will try finalize mutations more frequently. [#9427](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9427) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Fix replication protocol incompatibility introduced in [#8598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8598). [#9412](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9412) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))

[#9070](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/9070) [(urykhy)](https://github.com/urykhy)

### ClickHouse release v20.1.2.4, 2020-01-22

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Make the setting `merge_tree_uniform_read_distribution` obsolete. The server still recognizes this setting but it has no effect. [#8308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8308) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Changed return type of the function `greatCircleDistance` to `Float32` because now the result of calculation is `Float32`. [#7993](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7993) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Now it's expected that query parameters are represented in "escaped" format. For example, to pass string `a<tab>b` you have to write `a\tb` or `a\<tab>b` and respectively, `a%5Ctb` or `a%5C%09b` in URL. This is needed to add the possibility to pass NULL as `\N`. This fixes [#7488](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7488). [#8517](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8517) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Enable `use_minimalistic_part_header_in_zookeeper` setting for `ReplicatedMergeTree` by default. This will significantly reduce amount of data stored in ZooKeeper. This setting is supported since version 19.1 and we already use it in production in multiple services without any issues for more than half a year. Disable this setting if you have a chance to downgrade to versions older than 19.1. [#6850](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/6850) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Data skipping indices are production ready and enabled by default. The settings `allow_experimental_data_skipping_indices`, `allow_experimental_cross_to_join_conversion` and `allow_experimental_multiple_joins_emulation` are now obsolete and do nothing. [#7974](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7974) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Add new `ANY JOIN` logic for `StorageJoin` consistent with `JOIN` operation. To upgrade without changes in behaviour you need add `SETTINGS any_join_distinct_right_table_keys = 1` to Engine Join tables metadata or recreate these tables after upgrade. [#8400](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8400) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Require server to be restarted to apply the changes in logging configuration. This is a temporary workaround to avoid the bug where the server logs to a deleted log file (see [#8696](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8696)). [#8707](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8707) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm))

* Added `system.stack_trace` table that allows to look at stack traces of all server threads. This is useful for developers to introspect server state. This fixes [#7576](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7576). [#8344](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8344) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))

* Improvements in consistency of `ANY JOIN` logic. Now `t1 ANY LEFT JOIN t2` equals `t2 ANY RIGHT JOIN t1`. [#7665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7665) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Add setting `any_join_distinct_right_table_keys` which enables old behaviour for `ANY INNER JOIN`. [#7665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7665) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Add new `SEMI` and `ANTI JOIN`. Old `ANY INNER JOIN` behaviour now available as `SEMI LEFT JOIN`. [#7665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7665) ([Artem Zuikov](https://github.com/4ertus2))
* Added `Distributed` format for `File` engine and `file` table function which allows to read from `.bin` files generated by asynchronous  inserts into `Distributed` table. [#8535](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8535) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai))
* Add optional reset column argument for `runningAccumulate` which allows to reset aggregation results for each new key value. [#8326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8326) ([Sergey Kononenko](https://github.com/kononencheg))
* Add ability to use ClickHouse as Prometheus endpoint. [#7900](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7900) ([vdimir](https://github.com/Vdimir))
* Add section `<remote_url_allow_hosts>` in `config.xml` which restricts allowed hosts for remote table engines and table functions `URL`, `S3`, `HDFS`. [#7154](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7154) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb))
* Added function `greatCircleAngle` which calculates the distance on a sphere in degrees. [#8105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8105) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Changed Earth radius to be consistent with H3 library. [#8105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8105) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Added `JSONCompactEachRow` and `JSONCompactEachRowWithNamesAndTypes` formats for input and output. [#7841](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7841) ([Mikhail Korotov](https://github.com/millb))
* Added feature for file-related table engines and table functions (`File`, `S3`, `URL`, `HDFS`) which allows to read and write `gzip` files based on additional engine parameter or file extension. [#7840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7840) ([Andrey Bodrov](https://github.com/apbodrov))
* Added the `randomASCII(length)` function, generating a string with a random set of [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters) printable characters. [#8401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8401) ([BayoNet](https://github.com/BayoNet))
* Added function `JSONExtractArrayRaw` which returns an array on unparsed json array elements from `JSON` string. [#8081](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8081) ([Oleg Matrokhin](https://github.com/errx))

* Slightly better usability of error messages. Ask user not to remove the lines below `Stack trace:`. [#7897](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7897) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Better reading messages from `Kafka` engine in various formats after [#7935](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7935). [#8035](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8035) ([Ivan](https://github.com/abyss7))

* The settings `mark_cache_min_lifetime` is now obsolete and does nothing. In previous versions, mark cache can grow in memory larger than `mark_cache_size` to accomodate data within `mark_cache_min_lifetime` seconds. That was leading to confusion and higher memory usage than expected, that is especially bad on memory constrained systems. If you will see performance degradation after installing this release, you should increase the `mark_cache_size`. [#8484](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8484) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Preparation to use `tid` everywhere. This is needed for [#7477](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7477). [#8276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8276) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))

* Removed special cases of code for `tcmalloc`, because it's no longer supported. [#8225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8225) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* In CI coverage task, kill the server gracefully to allow it to save the coverage report. This fixes incomplete coverage reports we've been seeing lately. [#8142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8142) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Performance tests for all codecs against `Float64` and `UInt64` values. [#8349](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8349) ([Vasily Nemkov](https://github.com/Enmk))
* `termcap` is very much deprecated and lead to various problems (f.g. missing "up" cap and echoing `^J` instead of multi line) . Favor `terminfo` or bundled `ncurses`. [#7737](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7737) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird))
* Fix `test_storage_s3` integration test. [#7734](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7734) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai))
* Support `StorageFile(<format>, null) ` to insert block into given format file without actually write to disk. This is required for performance tests. [#8455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8455) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird))
* Added argument `--print-time` to functional tests which prints execution time per test. [#8001](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8001) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai))
* Added asserts to `KeyCondition` while evaluating RPN. This will fix warning from gcc-9. [#8279](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8279) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Dump cmake options in CI builds. [#8273](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8273) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm))
* Don't generate debug info for some fat libraries. [#8271](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8271) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Make `log_to_console.xml` always log to stderr, regardless of is it interactive or not. [#8395](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8395) ([Alexander Kuzmenkov](https://github.com/akuzm))
* Removed some unused features from `clickhouse-performance-test` tool. [#8555](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8555) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Now we will also search for `lld-X` with corresponding `clang-X` version. [#8092](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8092) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin))
* Parquet build improvement. [#8421](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8421) ([maxulan](https://github.com/maxulan))
* More GCC warnings [#8221](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8221) ([kreuzerkrieg](https://github.com/kreuzerkrieg))

* Update contrib/protobuf. [#8256](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8256) ([Matwey V. Kornilov](https://github.com/matwey))
* In preparation of switching to c++20 as a new year celebration. "May the C++ force be with ClickHouse." [#8447](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8447) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird))

#### Experimental Feature
* Added experimental setting `min_bytes_to_use_mmap_io`. It allows to read big files without copying data from kernel to userspace. The setting is disabled by default. Recommended threshold is about 64 MB, because mmap/munmap is slow. [#8520](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8520) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
* Reworked quotas as a part of access control system. Added new table `system.quotas`, new functions `currentQuota`, `currentQuotaKey`, new SQL syntax `CREATE QUOTA`, `ALTER QUOTA`, `DROP QUOTA`, `SHOW QUOTA`. [#7257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7257) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar))
* Allow skipping unknown settings with warnings instead of throwing exceptions. [#7653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7653) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar))
* Reworked row policies as a part of access control system. Added new table `system.row_policies`, new function `currentRowPolicies()`, new SQL syntax `CREATE POLICY`, `ALTER POLICY`, `DROP POLICY`, `SHOW CREATE POLICY`, `SHOW POLICIES`. [#7808](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/7808) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar))

#### Security Fix
* Fixed the possibility of reading directories structure in tables with `File` table engine. This fixes [#8536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8536). [#8537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8537) ([alexey-milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov))
