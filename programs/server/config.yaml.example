# Note that the amount of data in mapped files does not consume memory directly and is not accounted
# in query or server memory usage - because this memory can be discarded similar to OS page cache.

# List LDAP servers with their connection parameters here to later 1) use them as authenticators for dedicated local users,

# Parameters:
# host - LDAP server hostname or IP, this parameter is mandatory and cannot be empty.
# port - LDAP server port, default is 636 if enable_tls is set to true, 389 otherwise.
# bind_dn - template used to construct the DN to bind to.
# The resulting DN will be constructed by replacing all '{user_name}' substrings of the template with the actual
# user name during each authentication attempt.
# user_dn_detection - section with LDAP search parameters for detecting the actual user DN of the bound user.
# This is mainly used in search filters for further role mapping when the server is Active Directory. The
# resulting user DN will be used when replacing '{user_dn}' substrings wherever they are allowed. By default,
# user DN is set equal to bind DN, but once search is performed, it will be updated with to the actual detected
# user DN value.
# base_dn - template used to construct the base DN for the LDAP search.
# The resulting DN will be constructed by replacing all '{user_name}' and '{bind_dn}' substrings
# of the template with the actual user name and bind DN during the LDAP search.
# scope - scope of the LDAP search.
# Accepted values are: 'base', 'one_level', 'children', 'subtree' (the default).
# search_filter - template used to construct the search filter for the LDAP search.
# The resulting filter will be constructed by replacing all '{user_name}', '{bind_dn}', and '{base_dn}'
# substrings of the template with the actual user name, bind DN, and base DN during the LDAP search.
# Note, that the special characters must be escaped properly in XML.
# verification_cooldown - a period of time, in seconds, after a successful bind attempt, during which a user will be assumed
# to be successfully authenticated for all consecutive requests without contacting the LDAP server.
# Specify 0 (the default) to disable caching and force contacting the LDAP server for each authentication request.
# enable_tls - flag to trigger use of secure connection to the LDAP server.
# Specify 'no' for plain text (ldap://) protocol (not recommended).
# Specify 'yes' for LDAP over SSL/TLS (ldaps://) protocol (recommended, the default).
# Specify 'starttls' for legacy StartTLS protocol (plain text (ldap://) protocol, upgraded to TLS).
# tls_minimum_protocol_version - the minimum protocol version of SSL/TLS.
# Accepted values are: 'ssl2', 'ssl3', 'tls1.0', 'tls1.1', 'tls1.2' (the default).
# tls_require_cert - SSL/TLS peer certificate verification behavior.
# Accepted values are: 'never', 'allow', 'try', 'demand' (the default).
# tls_cert_file - path to certificate file.
# tls_key_file - path to certificate key file.
# tls_ca_cert_file - path to CA certificate file.
# tls_ca_cert_dir - path to the directory containing CA certificates.
# tls_cipher_suite - allowed cipher suite (in OpenSSL notation).
# Example:
# my_ldap_server:
#     host: localhost
#     port: 636
#     bind_dn: 'uid={user_name},ou=users,dc=example,dc=com'

# To enable Kerberos authentication support for HTTP requests (GSS-SPNEGO), for those users who are explicitly configured

#   # If no roles are specified here or assigned during role mapping (below), user will not be able to perform any
#   # actions after authentication.
#   # role_mapping - section with LDAP search parameters and mapping rules.
#   # When a user authenticates, while still bound to LDAP, an LDAP search is performed using search_filter and the
#   # name of the logged in user. For each entry found during that search, the value of the specified attribute is
#   # extracted. For each attribute value that has the specified prefix, the prefix is removed, and the rest of the
#   # value becomes the name of a local role defined in ClickHouse, which is expected to be created beforehand by

#   # There can be multiple 'role_mapping' sections defined inside the same 'ldap' section. All of them will be
#   # applied.
#   # base_dn - template used to construct the base DN for the LDAP search.
#   # The resulting DN will be constructed by replacing all '{user_name}', '{bind_dn}', and '{user_dn}'
#   # substrings of the template with the actual user name, bind DN, and user DN during each LDAP search.
#   # scope - scope of the LDAP search.
#   # Accepted values are: 'base', 'one_level', 'children', 'subtree' (the default).
#   # search_filter - template used to construct the search filter for the LDAP search.
#   # The resulting filter will be constructed by replacing all '{user_name}', '{bind_dn}', '{user_dn}', and

#   # each LDAP search.
#   # Note, that the special characters must be escaped properly in XML.
#   # attribute - attribute name whose values will be returned by the LDAP search. 'cn', by default.
#   # prefix - prefix, that will be expected to be in front of each string in the original list of strings returned by
#   # the LDAP search. Prefix will be removed from the original strings and resulting strings will be treated
#   # as local role names. Empty, by default.
#   # Example:

# The list of hosts allowed to use in URL-related storage engines and table functions.
# If this section is not present in configuration, all hosts are allowed.
# remote_url_allow_hosts:

# Host should be specified exactly as in URL. The name is checked before DNS resolution.
# Example: "yandex.ru", "yandex.ru." and "www.yandex.ru" are different hosts.
# If port is explicitly specified in URL, the host:port is checked as a whole.
# If host specified here without port, any port with this host allowed.
# "yandex.ru" -> "yandex.ru:443", "yandex.ru:80" etc. is allowed, but "yandex.ru:80" -> only "yandex.ru:80" is allowed.
# If the host is specified as IP address, it is checked as specified in URL. Example: "[2a02:6b8:a::a]".
# If there are redirects and support for redirects is enabled, every redirect (the Location field) is checked.

# Regular expression can be specified. RE2 engine is used for regexps.
# Regexps are not aligned: don't forget to add ^ and $. Also don't forget to escape dot (.) metacharacter
# (forgetting to do so is a common source of error).

# If element has 'incl' attribute, then for it's value will be used corresponding substitution from another file.
# By default, path to file with substitutions is /etc/metrika.xml. It could be changed in config in 'include_from' element.
# Values for substitutions are specified in /yandex/name_of_substitution elements in that file.
