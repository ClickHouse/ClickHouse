         To avoid frequent open/mmap/munmap/close calls (which are very expensive due to consequent page faults)
         and to reuse mappings from several threads and queries,
         the cache of mapped files is maintained. Its size is the number of mapped regions (usually equal to the number of mapped files).
         The amount of data in mapped files can be monitored

         Note that the amount of data in mapped files does not consume memory directly and is not accounted
         in query or server memory usage - because this memory can be discarded similar to OS page cache.
         The cache is dropped (the files are closed) automatically on removal of old parts in MergeTree,
         also it can be dropped manually by the SYSTEM DROP MMAP CACHE query.

             Parameters:
                host - LDAP server hostname or IP, this parameter is mandatory and cannot be empty.
                port - LDAP server port, default is 636 if enable_tls is set to true, 389 otherwise.
                bind_dn - template used to construct the DN to bind to.
                        The resulting DN will be constructed by replacing all '{user_name}' substrings of the template with the actual
                         user name during each authentication attempt.
                user_dn_detection - section with LDAP search parameters for detecting the actual user DN of the bound user.
                        This is mainly used in search filters for further role mapping when the server is Active Directory. The
                         resulting user DN will be used when replacing '{user_dn}' substrings wherever they are allowed. By default,
                         user DN is set equal to bind DN, but once search is performed, it will be updated with to the actual detected
                         user DN value.
                    base_dn - template used to construct the base DN for the LDAP search.
                            The resulting DN will be constructed by replacing all '{user_name}' and '{bind_dn}' substrings
                             of the template with the actual user name and bind DN during the LDAP search.
                    scope - scope of the LDAP search.
                            Accepted values are: 'base', 'one_level', 'children', 'subtree' (the default).
                    search_filter - template used to construct the search filter for the LDAP search.
                            The resulting filter will be constructed by replacing all '{user_name}', '{bind_dn}', and '{base_dn}'
                             substrings of the template with the actual user name, bind DN, and base DN during the LDAP search.
                            Note, that the special characters must be escaped properly in XML.
                verification_cooldown - a period of time, in seconds, after a successful bind attempt, during which a user will be assumed
                         to be successfully authenticated for all consecutive requests without contacting the LDAP server.
                        Specify 0 (the default) to disable caching and force contacting the LDAP server for each authentication request.
                enable_tls - flag to trigger use of secure connection to the LDAP server.
                        Specify 'no' for plain text (ldap://) protocol (not recommended).
                        Specify 'yes' for LDAP over SSL/TLS (ldaps://) protocol (recommended, the default).
                        Specify 'starttls' for legacy StartTLS protocol (plain text (ldap://) protocol, upgraded to TLS).
                tls_minimum_protocol_version - the minimum protocol version of SSL/TLS.
                        Accepted values are: 'ssl2', 'ssl3', 'tls1.0', 'tls1.1', 'tls1.2' (the default).
                tls_require_cert - SSL/TLS peer certificate verification behavior.
                        Accepted values are: 'never', 'allow', 'try', 'demand' (the default).
                tls_cert_file - path to certificate file.
                tls_key_file - path to certificate key file.
                tls_ca_cert_file - path to CA certificate file.
                tls_ca_cert_dir - path to the directory containing CA certificates.
                tls_cipher_suite - allowed cipher suite (in OpenSSL notation).

                    This parameter cannot be specified together with 'realm' parameter.
            realm - a realm, that will be used to restrict authentication to only those requests whose initiator's realm matches it.
                    This parameter is optional, if omitted, no additional filtering by realm will be applied.

        <!-- To add an LDAP server as a remote user directory of users that are not defined locally, define a single 'ldap' section
              with the following parameters:
                server - one of LDAP server names defined in 'ldap_servers' config section above.
                        This parameter is mandatory and cannot be empty.
                roles - section with a list of locally defined roles that will be assigned to each user retrieved from the LDAP server.
                        If no roles are specified here or assigned during role mapping (below), user will not be able to perform any
                         actions after authentication.
                role_mapping - section with LDAP search parameters and mapping rules.
                        When a user authenticates, while still bound to LDAP, an LDAP search is performed using search_filter and the
                         name of the logged in user. For each entry found during that search, the value of the specified attribute is
                         extracted. For each attribute value that has the specified prefix, the prefix is removed, and the rest of the
                         value becomes the name of a local role defined in ClickHouse, which is expected to be created beforehand by
                         CREATE ROLE command.
                        There can be multiple 'role_mapping' sections defined inside the same 'ldap' section. All of them will be
                         applied.
                    base_dn - template used to construct the base DN for the LDAP search.
                            The resulting DN will be constructed by replacing all '{user_name}', '{bind_dn}', and '{user_dn}'
                             substrings of the template with the actual user name, bind DN, and user DN during each LDAP search.
                    scope - scope of the LDAP search.
                            Accepted values are: 'base', 'one_level', 'children', 'subtree' (the default).
                    search_filter - template used to construct the search filter for the LDAP search.
                            The resulting filter will be constructed by replacing all '{user_name}', '{bind_dn}', '{user_dn}', and
                             '{base_dn}' substrings of the template with the actual user name, bind DN, user DN, and base DN during
                             each LDAP search.
                            Note, that the special characters must be escaped properly in XML.
                    attribute - attribute name whose values will be returned by the LDAP search. 'cn', by default.
                    prefix - prefix, that will be expected to be in front of each string in the original list of strings returned by
                             the LDAP search. Prefix will be removed from the original strings and resulting strings will be treated
                             as local role names. Empty, by default.
             Example:
                <ldap>
                    <server>my_ldap_server</server>
                    <roles>
