            <!-- List of networks with open access.

                 To open access from everywhere, specify:
                    <ip>::/0</ip>

                 To open access only from localhost, specify:
                    <ip>::1</ip>
                    <ip>127.0.0.1</ip>

                 Each element of list has one of the following forms:
                 <ip> IP-address or network mask. Examples: 213.180.204.3 or 10.0.0.1/8 or 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.0
                     2a02:6b8::3 or 2a02:6b8::3/64 or 2a02:6b8::3/ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::.
                 <host> Hostname. Example: server01.yandex.ru.
                     To check access, DNS query is performed, and all received addresses compared to peer address.
                 <host_regexp> Regular expression for host names. Example, ^server\d\d-\d\d-\d\.yandex\.ru$
                     To check access, DNS PTR query is performed for peer address and then regexp is applied.
                     Then, for result of PTR query, another DNS query is performed and all received addresses compared to peer address.
                     Strongly recommended that regexp is ends with $
                 All results of DNS requests are cached till server restart.
