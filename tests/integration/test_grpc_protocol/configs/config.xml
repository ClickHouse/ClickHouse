            The default table creation code is insufficient, this <engine> spec
            is a workaround. There is no 'event_time' for this log, but two times,
            start and finish. It is sorted by finish time, to avoid inserting
            data too far away in the past (probably we can sometimes insert a span
            that is seconds earlier than the last span in the table, due to a race
            between several spans inserted in parallel). This gives the spans a
            global order that we can use to e.g. retry insertion into some external
            system.
