        <!-- Structured log formatting:
        You can specify log format(for now, JSON only). In that case, the console log will be printed
        in specified format like JSON.
        For example, as below:
        {"date_time":"1650918987.180175","thread_name":"#1","thread_id":"254545","level":"Trace","query_id":"","logger_name":"BaseDaemon","message":"Received signal 2","source_file":"../base/daemon/BaseDaemon.cpp; virtual void SignalListener::run()","source_line":"192"}
        To enable JSON logging support, just uncomment <formatting> tag below.
        -->
        <formatting>json</formatting>
    </logger>
