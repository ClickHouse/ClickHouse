# Misbehaving pooled UDF: it answers every request correctly and then writes one more byte to its
# `stdout` - the accident a stray `print` or a forgotten newline is. Nothing in the exchange notices
# it, because the answer itself was read in full and the result lives in the shared-memory region;
# the byte is only ever read by the *next* request on the same process, as the status varint of a
# response that has not been sent yet. The server must therefore refuse to return this worker to the
# pool, so the damage stays inside the invocation that caused it.
