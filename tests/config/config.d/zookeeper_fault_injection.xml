        <!-- Settings for fault injection.
          Approximate probability of request success:
            (1 - send_fault_probability) * (1 - recv_fault_probability) = 0.99998 * 0.99998 = 0.99996
          Actually it will be less, because if some request fails due to fault injection,
          then all requests which are in the queue now also fail.
          In other words, session will expire 4 times per 99996 successful requests
          or approximately each 25000 requests (on average).
