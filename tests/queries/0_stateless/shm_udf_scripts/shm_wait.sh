# Waits, from inside a `clickhouse-local` session, for a state of a command's process that nothing
# in SQL can observe, so that the next query starts only once that state is provably reached rather
# than after a sleep long enough to hope for it. Runs as an `executable` table function: reads the
# pid of the process from stdin and prints `1` once the state is there, or `0` if it is not reached
# within a few seconds - under the table function's own read timeout.
#
#   shm_wait.sh blocked        - the process is blocked in `write` on a full pipe nobody reads
#   shm_wait.sh exited         - the process has exited (a zombie for its parent to reap, or gone)
#   shm_wait.sh file <path>    - the file exists; it is removed once seen, so that a command that
#                                creates it again can be waited for again (the pid on stdin is not used)
#   shm_wait.sh touch <path>   - not a wait: creates the file - the signal a command waits for in
#                                `go_signal.py` - and prints `1` (the pid on stdin is not used)
