Test 1: ProfileEvents for hybrid storage exist
HybridStorageBytesReadFromRow
HybridStorageBytesWrittenToRow
HybridStorageChecksumMismatches
HybridStorageColumnBasedReads
HybridStorageRowBasedReads
HybridStorageRowDeserializationMicroseconds
HybridStorageRowSerializationMicroseconds
HybridStorageRowsReadFromRow
HybridStorageRowsTooLarge
HybridStorageRowsWrittenToRow
Test 2: Wide query ProfileEvents
Test 3: Narrow query ProfileEvents
Test 4: Verify ProfileEvents are tracked
HybridStorageBytesReadFromRow	Number of bytes read from __row column in hybrid storage.
HybridStorageColumnBasedReads	Number of times column-based reading (traditional) was used when hybrid storage is enabled.
HybridStorageRowBasedReads	Number of times row-based reading (from __row column) was used in hybrid storage.
HybridStorageRowDeserializationMicroseconds	Time spent deserializing row data from hybrid storage.
HybridStorageRowSerializationMicroseconds	Time spent serializing row data for hybrid storage.
Test 5: Performance benchmark - point query
Benchmark: Point query with all columns
Benchmark: Wide query with range filter
Benchmark: Narrow query for comparison
Test 6: Comparison with hybrid storage disabled
Without hybrid storage - wide query
Test 7: Row size limit behavior
1	11
2	2000
Test 8: Storage overhead check
Hybrid storage row count:	10000
Normal storage row count:	10000
All hybrid storage metrics tests passed
