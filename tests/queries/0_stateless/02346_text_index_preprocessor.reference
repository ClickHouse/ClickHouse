Negative tests on preprocessor construction validations.
- The preprocessor argument must not reference non-indexed columns
- Index definition may not be and expression when there is preprocessor
-- Not even the same expression
- The preprocessor must be an expression
- The preprocessor must be an expression, with existing functions
- The preprocessor must have input and output values of the same type (here: String)
- The preprocessor expression must use the column identifier
- The preprocessor expression must use only deterministic functions
- The preprocessor expression is not compatible with array columns (yet)
