# - no-darwin: the commands are waited for through `/proc`

# The worker answers, closes its stdout and waits for both of its inputs to reach EOF. A hung-up
# stdout is a worker that cannot serve anyone else, so it is discarded - and with `check_exit_code`
# the query is entitled to its exit status, which means the server has to let it exit. Closing only
# its stdin would leave it reading its second input: the wait would run out and the query would fail
# for an exit code it could have had. `command_termination_timeout` is short on purpose: the answer
# has to come back without anything waiting that budget out.
