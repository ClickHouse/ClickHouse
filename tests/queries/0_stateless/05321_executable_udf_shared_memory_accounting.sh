# How the shared-memory region of an executable UDF are accounted for. A region is charged to one
# memory tracker at a time: to the query while a query uses it, and to the server while a pooled
# worker holding it sits idle in the pool. Each scenario runs in a `clickhouse-local` of its own,
# so it starts from a process that holds no region and no charge.
