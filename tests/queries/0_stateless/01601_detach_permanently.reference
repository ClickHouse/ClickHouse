database atomic tests
can not create table with same name as detached permanently
can not detach twice
can not drop detached
can not replace with the other table
can still show the create statement
Row 1:
──────
statement: CREATE TABLE test1601_detach_permanently_atomic.test_name_reuse
(
    `number` UInt64
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY tuple()
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192
can not attach with bad uuid
can attach with short syntax
100
can not detach permanently the table which is already detached (temporary)
100
After database reattachement the table is back (it was detached temporary)
And we can detach it permanently
After database reattachement the table is still absent (it was detached permamently)
And we can not detach it permanently
But we can attach it back
And detach permanently again to check how database drop will behave
DROP database
