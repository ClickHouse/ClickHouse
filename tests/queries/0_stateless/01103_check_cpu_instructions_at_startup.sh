# More than a decade after AVX was released, AVX is still not supported by QEMU, even if "-cpu help" pretends to. As a result, we cannot use
# QEMU to verify that a ClickHouse binary compiled for a SIMD level up to AVX runs on a system with a SIMD level up to AVX. The alternative
# is to disassemble the binary and grep for unwanted instructions (e.g. AVX512) which is just too fragile ...
