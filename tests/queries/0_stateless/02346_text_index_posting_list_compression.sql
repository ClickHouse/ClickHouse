-- This test compares two identical tables that differ only in the text index posting-list compression setting (posting_list_codec).
-- The inserted data covers a range of posting-list shapes:
-- - very large lists (aa/bb/cc),
-- - a block-boundary case (129 hits = 128 + tail),
-- - a medium non-aligned size (1003 hits),
-- - a single-hit list, and
-- - very sparse lists (2 and 5 hits).
-- After OPTIMIZE FINAL to stabilize on-disk parts, each hasToken() query validates that the compressed
-- and uncompressed tables return identical counts (and matches expected exact counts for key tokens),
-- ensuring correctness across full blocks, tail blocks, and small-N cases.
