#   1. vs merge, the DELETE parked: the merge retires the DELETE's target, so the partition is rescanned and the DELETE applies
#   3. vs insert, the DELETE parked: no conflict, both commit, the INSERT's rows are neither killed nor lost
#   4. vs DELETE, both parked: two overlapping DELETEs both commit, and each matched row is dead once
#   5. vs TRUNCATE, the DELETE parked: the target is gone, so the rescan finds nothing and the DELETE leaves no marker part
# no-parallel: the failpoints are server-wide.
