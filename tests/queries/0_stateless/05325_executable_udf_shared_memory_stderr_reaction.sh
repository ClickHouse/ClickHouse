# - no-darwin: shared-memory regions for executable UDFs are supported only on Linux

# How `stderr_reaction` and the timeouts apply to a single query of the shared-memory transport: stderr
# a command writes at startup, just before or on its way out, or after answering, and a command that is
# slow to exit or stops answering. Each scenario runs in a `clickhouse-local` of its own, so its log is
# its own. What a pooled worker leaves behind between borrows is in
# `05324_executable_udf_shared_memory_stderr`.
