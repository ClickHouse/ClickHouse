    -10,
    not(true),
    11 = 11,
    12 != 13,
    14 < 15,
    16 > 15,
    17 <= 18,
    19 >= 18,
    true AND false,

FROM system.one
Edge case: operator with column reference

FROM system.numbers
LIMIT 1
Edge case: operators in WHERE clause
SELECT *
FROM system.numbers
WHERE number > 0 AND number < 10
LIMIT 1
Edge case: operators in GROUP BY
SELECT number + 1 AS n
FROM system.numbers
GROUP BY n
LIMIT 1
