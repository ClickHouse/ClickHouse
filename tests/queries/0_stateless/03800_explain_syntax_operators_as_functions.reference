    12 != 13,
    14 < 15,
    16 > 15,
    17 <= 18,
    19 >= 18,
    true AND false,
    true OR false

Edge case: operator with column reference
SELECT number + 1
FROM system.numbers
LIMIT 1
Edge case: operators in WHERE clause
SELECT *
FROM system.numbers
WHERE number > 0 AND number < 10
LIMIT 1
Edge case: operators in GROUP BY
SELECT number + 1 AS n
FROM system.numbers
GROUP BY n
LIMIT 1
