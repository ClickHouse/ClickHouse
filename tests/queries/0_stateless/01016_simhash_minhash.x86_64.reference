ClickHouse makes full use of all available hardware to process each request as quickly as possible. Peak performance for a single query is over 2 terabytes per second (using columns after decompression only). In a distributed setup, reads are automatically balanced across healthy replicas to avoid increased latency.\nClickHouse supports asynchronous multi-master replication and can be deployed across multiple data centers. All nodes are equal to avoid a single point of failure. Downtime for one site or the entire data center will not affect the read / write availability of the system.\nClickHouse is simple and works out of the box. It simplifies all processing of your data: it loads all your structured data into the system and immediately becomes available for building reports. The SQL dialect allows you to express the desired result without resorting to any of the non-standard APIs found in some alternative systems.\n:::::::\nClickHouse makes full use of all available hardware to process each request as quickly as possible.

ClickHouse uses all available hardware to its full potential to process each query as fast as possible. Peak processing performance for a single query stands at more than 2 terabytes per second (after decompression, only used columns). In distributed setup reads are automatically balanced among healthy replicas to avoid increasing latency.\nClickHouse supports multi-master asynchronous replication and can be deployed across multiple datacenters. All nodes are equal, which allows avoiding having single points of failure. Downtime of a single node or the whole datacenter wont affect the systems availability for both reads and writes.\nClickHouse is simple and works out-of-the-box. It streamlines all your data processing: ingest all your structured data into the system and it becomes instantly available for building reports.

ClickHouse uses all available hardware to its full potential to process each query as fast as possible. Peak processing performance for a single query stands at more than 2 terabytes per second (after decompression, only used columns). In distributed setup reads are automatically balanced among healthy replicas to avoid increasing latency.\nClickHouse supports multi-master asynchronous replication and can be deployed across multiple datacenters.
