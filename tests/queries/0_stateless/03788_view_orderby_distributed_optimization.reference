=== Test 1: Simple view with ORDER BY (should use merge sort) ===
Expression (Project names)
  Limit (preliminary LIMIT (without OFFSET))
    Sorting (Merge sorted streams for ORDER BY, without aggregation)
      Union
        Sorting (Sorting for ORDER BY)

=== Test 2: View with existing ORDER BY ===
