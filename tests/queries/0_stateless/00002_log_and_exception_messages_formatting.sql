-- Unlike above, here we look at length of the formatted message, not format string. Most short format strings are fine because they end up decorated with context from outer or inner exceptions, e.g.:
-- "Expected end of line" -> "Code: 117. DB::Exception: Expected end of line: (in file/uri /var/lib/clickhouse/user_files/data_02118): (at row 1)"
-- But we have to cut out the boilerplate, e.g.:
-- "Code: 60. DB::Exception: Table default.a does not exist. (UNKNOWN_TABLE), Stack trace" -> "Table default.a does not exist."
-- This table currently doesn't have enough information to do this reliably, so we just regex search for " (ERROR_NAME_IN_CAPS)" and hope that's good enough.
-- For the "Code: 123. DB::Exception: " part, we just subtract 26 instead of searching for it. Because sometimes it's not at the start, e.g.:
-- "Unexpected error, will try to restart main thread: Code: 341. DB::Exception: Unexpected error: Code: 57. DB::Exception:[...]"
