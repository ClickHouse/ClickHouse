# no-fasttest: the remote distributed plan needs the stateless worker configuration.
# A satisfied `LIMIT` must stop the upstream stages even when nothing flows through them
# anymore. Probe rows match the first join only in the first block, so after that block every
# stage upstream of the `LIMIT` goes silent. The backward stop must then cross idle exchanges:
# an idle `StreamingExchangeSink` must hear the `NoMoreDataNeeded` packet on its socket instead
# of with the next output chunk (which never comes), and an idle `StreamingExchangeSource` must
# notice that its output port was closed even though its peer sends no data, and forward
# `NoMoreDataNeeded` one hop upstream. If either half is missing, the sleeping scan runs on for
# 100+ seconds.
#
# The stop is checked in the tasks' `system.query_log` rows, not by elapsed time;
# `max_execution_time` is only a backstop against a hang.

# The probe scan sleeps 1s per 1000-row block. The first block satisfies the `LIMIT` through both
# joins; rows of later blocks are shifted by 10000000, so the first join matches nothing and its
# stage never touches its sink again. The two joins use different keys, so an exchange separates
# their stages and the stop signal has to cross it backward.
# Pinned: `max_block_size` and `index_granularity` keep `sleepEachRow` under its 3s per-block cap,
# `max_threads` keeps the full scan slower than the timeout, `join_algorithm` because a sorting
# join returns no rows until it reads all input, `min_joined_block_size_*` because squashing
# before the join would hold the first rows back until enough blocks accumulate,
# `max_rows_to_group_by` because the CI profile sets it and `make_distributed_plan` rejects
# an aggregation with a row limit, and the join order because a swap makes the probe table
# the build side, which also reads all input before the first row.
# The bucket counts are pinned because the reference is derived from them, and
# `distributed_plan_fallback_to_local_execution` so a plan that cannot be distributed fails.
