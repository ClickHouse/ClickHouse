# What a pooled command of the pipe transport writes besides its rows, and when: with them, after them,
# or once it is back in the pool. A pooled worker has to go back to the pool only at a clean boundary,
# output one borrow left must not be read or attributed by the next, and a chatty command must never
# be left blocked. Each scenario runs in a `clickhouse-local` of its own, so its log and its pool are
# its own. The commands answer with their pid, which tells a reused worker from a fresh one. A command
# that is to write something once the query it answered is over waits for the next statement to say
# so (`shm_wait.sh touch`, `go_signal.py`), and `shm_wait.sh` waits for a state of a worker that
# nothing in SQL can observe - instead of sleeps long enough to hope for either. The shared-memory
# twin of this test is `05324_executable_udf_shared_memory_stderr`.
