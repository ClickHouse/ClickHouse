# into a constant is shared the same way. A lambda rebuilt from a serialized query plan must honor
# `enable_adaptive_short_circuit_lazy_execution` as well. The results must match the static short-circuit
# schedule in every case; a data race on the shared instance is caught by the sanitizer builds.
