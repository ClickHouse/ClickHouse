ClickHouse makes full use of all available hardware to process each request as quickly as possible. Peak performance for a single query is over 2 terabytes per second (using columns after decompression only). In a distributed setup, reads are automatically balanced across healthy replicas to avoid increased latency.\nClickHouse supports asynchronous multi-master replication and can be deployed across multiple data centers. All nodes are equal to avoid a single point of failure. Downtime for one site or the entire data center will not affect the read / write availability of the system.\nClickHouse is simple and works out of the box. It simplifies all processing of your data: it loads all your structured data into the system and immediately becomes available for building reports. The SQL dialect allows you to express the desired result without resorting to any of the non-standard APIs found in some alternative systems.\n:::::::\nClickHouse makes full use of all available hardware to process each request as quickly as possible.

ClickHouse makes full use of all available hardware to process each request as quickly as possible. Peak performance for a single query is over 2 terabytes per second (used columns only after unpacking). In a distributed setup, reads are automatically balanced across healthy replicas to avoid increased latency.\nClickHouse supports asynchronous multi-master replication and can be deployed across multiple data centers. All nodes are equal to avoid a single point of failure. Downtime for one site or the entire data center will not affect the system\'s read / write availability.\nClickHouse is simple and works out of the box. It simplifies all the processing of your data: it loads all your structured data into the system, and they are immediately available for building reports. The SQL dialect allows you to express the desired result without resorting to any of the non-standard APIs found in some alternative systems.\n:::::::\nClickHouse makes full use of all available hardware to process each request as quickly as possible.
