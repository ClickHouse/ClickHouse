### Update comment on the change ###
# 4 HOUR - is a balance to get the most precise values
#   - Our longest possible running check is around 5h on the worst scenario
#   - The long queue won't be wiped out and replaced, so the measurmenet is fine
#   - If the data is spoiled by something, we are from the bills perspective
# Changed it to 3 HOUR: in average we have 1h tasks, but p90 is around 2h.
# With 4h we have too much wasted computing time in case of issues with DB
