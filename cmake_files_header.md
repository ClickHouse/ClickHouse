# CMake in ClickHouse

## TL; DR How to make ClickHouse compile and link faster?

Developer only!  This command will likely fulfil most of your needs. Run before calling `ninja`.

```
cmake ..
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_ALL=OFF
    -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_SERVER=ON
    -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_CLIENT=ON
    -DUSE_STATIC_LIBRARIES=OFF
    -DCLICKHOUSE_SPLIT_BINARY=ON
    -DSPLIT_SHARED_LIBRARIES=ON
    -DUNBUNDLED=ON
    -DENABLE_UTILS=OFF
    -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF
```

## CMake files types

1. ClickHouse's source CMake files (located in the root directory and in `/src`).
2. Arch-dependent CMake files (located in `/cmake/*os_name*`).
3. Libraries finders (search for contrib libraries, located in `/cmake/find`).
3. Contrib build CMake files (used instead of libraries' own CMake files, located in `/cmake/modules`)

## List of CMake flags

* This list is auto-generated by [this bash script](bash.sh).
* The flag name is a link to its position in the code.
* If an option's default valus is itself an option, it's also a link to its position in this list.
