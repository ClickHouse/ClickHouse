Update from @BohuTANG:

> Thanks for the benchmark!
> Databend is a cloud warehouse designed for object storage(like Amazon S3), not the local file system. The FS model is only used for testing for some cases, we didn't do any optimization, and we know it has some performance issues.
> I believe that ClickHouse is also being designed for the cloud, and looking forward to the S3 benchmark results :)
