An attempt to use their service resulted in a failure. It showed "Error: cannot create connection" shortly after registration and advised to ask for support. I emailed to support, but no one answered. The UI of their service looks sketchy like it was outsourced or amateur work. The last update of their documentation is dated Dec 2020.

Have a nice day.
