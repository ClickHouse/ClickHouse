## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a potential vulnerability in ClickHouse please send the details about it to [security@clickhouse.com](mailto:security@clickhouse.com).

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in ClickHouse
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects ClickHouse

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help tuning ClickHouse components for security
- You need help applying security related updates
- Your issue is not security related

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by ClickHouse maintainers within 5 working days.
As the security issue moves from triage, to identified fix, to release planning we will keep the reporter updated.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the ClickHouse maintainers and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to 90 days. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days.
