**Describe the issue**
A clear and concise description of what works not as it is supposed to.

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server versions are incompatible
* Which interface to use, if matters
* Non-default settings, if any
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
