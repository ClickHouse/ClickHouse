/* An OFFSET_REF is used in two situations:

   1. An expression of the form `A::m' where `A' is a class and `m' is
      a non-static member.  In this case, operand 0 will be a TYPE
      (corresponding to `A') and operand 1 will be a FIELD_DECL,
      BASELINK, or TEMPLATE_ID_EXPR (corresponding to `m').

      The expression is a pointer-to-member if its address is taken,
      but simply denotes a member of the object if its address is not
      taken.

      This form is only used during the parsing phase; once semantic
      analysis has taken place they are eliminated.

   2. An expression of the form `x.*p'.  In this case, operand 0 will
      be an expression corresponding to `x' and operand 1 will be an
      expression with pointer-to-member type.  */
