/* Before including this file, define a macro:

     DEF_GCOV_COUNTER(COUNTER, NAME, FN_TYPE)

   This macro will be expanded to all supported gcov counters, their
   names, or the type of handler functions.  FN_TYPE will be
   expanded to a handler function, like in gcov_merge, it is
   expanded to __gcov_merge ## FN_TYPE.  */
