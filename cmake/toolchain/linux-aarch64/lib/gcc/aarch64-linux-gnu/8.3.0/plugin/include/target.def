\n\
@findex regs_ever_live\n\
To determine which registers to save, the macro can refer to the array\n\
@code{regs_ever_live}: element @var{r} is nonzero if hard register\n\
@var{r} is used anywhere within the function.  This implies the function\n\
prologue should save register @var{r}, provided it is not one of the\n\

\n\
On machines that have ``register windows'', the function entry code does\n\
not save on the stack the registers that are in the windows, even if\n\

appropriate steps to ``push'' the register stack, if any non-call-used\n\
registers are used in the function.\n\
\n\
@findex frame_pointer_needed\n\
On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the\n\

pointer if one is wanted, and not otherwise.  To determine whether a\n\
frame pointer is in wanted, the macro can refer to the variable\n\

time in a function that needs a frame pointer.  @xref{Elimination}.\n\

The function entry code is responsible for allocating any stack space\n\

@code{CALL_USED_REGISTERS} in the same way.\n\
\n\
On some machines, there is a single instruction that does all the work\n\

the real function.\n\
\n\
First, emit code to add the integer @var{delta} to the location that\n\
contains the incoming first argument.  Assume that this argument\n\
contains a pointer, and is the one used to pass the @code{this} pointer\n\
in C++.  This is the incoming argument @emph{before} the function prologue,\n\
e.g.@: @samp{%o0} on a sparc.  The addition must preserve the values of\n\
all other incoming arguments.\n\
\n\
Then, if @var{vcall_offset} is nonzero, an additional adjustment should be\n\
made after adding @code{delta}.  In particular, if @var{p} is the\n\
adjusted pointer, the following adjustment should be made:\n\

@smallexample\n\
    ldr r10, [r1, 4]\n\
    add r4, r4, r10\n\
    ldr r15, [r2, 8]\n\
    sub r5, r5, r15\n\
    ldr r11, [r1, 0]\n\
    add r4, r4, r11\n\
    ldr r16, [r2, 12]\n\
    sub r5, r5, r16\n\
@end smallexample\n\
\n\
On targets like ARM/AArch64, the two pairs of consecutive loads should be\n\
merged.  Since peephole2 pass can't help in this case unless consecutive\n\
loads are actually next to each other in instruction flow.  That's where\n\
this scheduling fusion pass works.  This hook calculates priority for each\n\
instruction based on its fustion type, like:\n\
\n\
@smallexample\n\
    ldr r10, [r1, 4]  ; fusion_pri=99,  pri=96\n\
    add r4, r4, r10   ; fusion_pri=100, pri=100\n\
    ldr r15, [r2, 8]  ; fusion_pri=98,  pri=92\n\
    sub r5, r5, r15   ; fusion_pri=100, pri=100\n\
    ldr r11, [r1, 0]  ; fusion_pri=99,  pri=100\n\
    add r4, r4, r11   ; fusion_pri=100, pri=100\n\
    ldr r16, [r2, 12] ; fusion_pri=98,  pri=88\n\
    sub r5, r5, r16   ; fusion_pri=100, pri=100\n\
@end smallexample\n\
\n\
Scheduling fusion pass then sorts all ready to issue instructions according\n\
to the priorities.  As a result, instructions of same fusion type will be\n\
pushed together in instruction flow, like:\n\
\n\
@smallexample\n\
    ldr r11, [r1, 0]\n\
    ldr r10, [r1, 4]\n\
    ldr r15, [r2, 8]\n\
    ldr r16, [r2, 12]\n\
    add r4, r4, r10\n\
    sub r5, r5, r15\n\
    add r4, r4, r11\n\
    sub r5, r5, r16\n\
@end smallexample\n\
\n\
Now peephole2 pass can simply merge the two pairs of loads.\n\
\n\
Since scheduling fusion pass relies on peephole2 to do real fusion\n\
work, it is only enabled by default when peephole2 is in effect.\n\
\n\
This is firstly introduced on ARM/AArch64 targets, please refer to\n\

Legitimate addresses are defined in two variants: a strict variant and a\n\
non-strict one.  The @var{strict} parameter chooses which variant is\n\
desired by the caller.\n\
\n\
The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It must be defined so\n\
that any pseudo-register that has not been allocated a hard register is\n\
considered a memory reference.  This is because in contexts where some\n\
kind of register is required, a pseudo-register with no hard register\n\

up the @code{reg_renumber} array; it should then proceed using the hard\n\
register number in the array, or treat the pseudo as a memory reference\n\
if the array holds @code{-1}.\n\

register is required.\n\

constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums\n\
specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply\n\
recognize any @code{const} as legitimate.\n\
\n\
Usually @code{PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS} is not prepared to handle constant\n\
sums that are not marked with  @code{const}.  It assumes that a naked\n\
@code{plus} indicates indexing.  If so, then you @emph{must} reject such\n\
naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of them will\n\

 "Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly to or\n\
from memory or even from other types of registers.  An example is the\n\
@samp{MQ} register, which on most machines, can only be copied to or\n\
from general registers, but not memory.  Below, we shall be using the\n\
term 'intermediate register' when a move operation cannot be performed\n\
directly, but has to be done by copying the source into the intermediate\n\
register first, and then copying the intermediate register to the\n\
destination.  An intermediate register always has the same mode as\n\
source and destination.  Since it holds the actual value being copied,\n\
reload might apply optimizations to re-use an intermediate register\n\
and eliding the copy from the source when it can determine that the\n\
intermediate register still holds the required value.\n\
\n\
Another kind of secondary reload is required on some machines which\n\
allow copying all registers to and from memory, but require a scratch\n\
register for stores to some memory locations (e.g., those with symbolic\n\
address on the RT, and those with certain symbolic address on the SPARC\n\
when compiling PIC)@.  Scratch registers need not have the same mode\n\
as the value being copied, and usually hold a different value than\n\
that being copied.  Special patterns in the md file are needed to\n\
describe how the copy is performed with the help of the scratch register;\n\
these patterns also describe the number, register class(es) and mode(s)\n\
of the scratch register(s).\n\
\n\
In some cases, both an intermediate and a scratch register are required.\n\
\n\
For input reloads, this target hook is called with nonzero @var{in_p},\n\
and @var{x} is an rtx that needs to be copied to a register of class\n\
@var{reload_class} in @var{reload_mode}.  For output reloads, this target\n\
hook is called with zero @var{in_p}, and a register of class @var{reload_class}\n\
needs to be copied to rtx @var{x} in @var{reload_mode}.\n\
\n\
If copying a register of @var{reload_class} from/to @var{x} requires\n\
an intermediate register, the hook @code{secondary_reload} should\n\
return the register class required for this intermediate register.\n\
If no intermediate register is required, it should return NO_REGS.\n\
If more than one intermediate register is required, describe the one\n\
that is closest in the copy chain to the reload register.\n\
\n\
If scratch registers are needed, you also have to describe how to\n\
perform the copy from/to the reload register to/from this\n\
closest intermediate register.  Or if no intermediate register is\n\
required, but still a scratch register is needed, describe the\n\
copy  from/to the reload register to/from the reload operand @var{x}.\n\
\n\
You do this by setting @code{sri->icode} to the instruction code of a pattern\n\
in the md file which performs the move.  Operands 0 and 1 are the output\n\
and input of this copy, respectively.  Operands from operand 2 onward are\n\
for scratch operands.  These scratch operands must have a mode, and a\n\
single-register-class\n\
@c [later: or memory]\n\
output constraint.\n\
\n\
When an intermediate register is used, the @code{secondary_reload}\n\
hook will be called again to determine how to copy the intermediate\n\
register to/from the reload operand @var{x}, so your hook must also\n\
have code to handle the register class of the intermediate operand.\n\
\n\
@c [For later: maybe we'll allow multi-alternative reload patterns -\n\
@c   the port maintainer could name a mov<mode> pattern that has clobbers -\n\
@c   and match the constraints of input and output to determine the required\n\
@c   alternative.  A restriction would be that constraints used to match\n\
@c   against reloads registers would have to be written as register class\n\
@c   constraints, or we need a new target macro / hook that tells us if an\n\
@c   arbitrary constraint can match an unknown register of a given class.\n\
@c   Such a macro / hook would also be useful in other places.]\n\
\n\
\n\
@var{x} might be a pseudo-register or a @code{subreg} of a\n\
pseudo-register, which could either be in a hard register or in memory.\n\
Use @code{true_regnum} to find out; it will return @minus{}1 if the pseudo is\n\
in memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.\n\
\n\
Scratch operands in memory (constraint @code{\"=m\"} / @code{\"=&m\"}) are\n\
currently not supported.  For the time being, you will have to continue\n\
to use @code{TARGET_SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED} for that purpose.\n\
\n\
@code{copy_cost} also uses this target hook to find out how values are\n\
copied.  If you want it to include some extra cost for the need to allocate\n\
(a) scratch register(s), set @code{sri->extra_cost} to the additional cost.\n\
Or if two dependent moves are supposed to have a lower cost than the sum\n\
of the individual moves due to expected fortuitous scheduling and/or special\n\

another, smaller class.\n\
\n\
The default version of this hook always returns value of @code{rclass} argument.\n\
\n\
Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code.  For\n\
example, on the 68000, when @var{x} is an integer constant that is in range\n\
for a @samp{moveq} instruction, the value of this macro is always\n\
@code{DATA_REGS} as long as @var{rclass} includes the data registers.\n\
Requiring a data register guarantees that a @samp{moveq} will be used.\n\
\n\
One case where @code{TARGET_PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS} must not return\n\
@var{rclass} is if @var{x} is a legitimate constant which cannot be\n\
loaded into some register class.  By returning @code{NO_REGS} you can\n\
force @var{x} into a memory location.  For example, rs6000 can load\n\
immediate values into general-purpose registers, but does not have an\n\
instruction for loading an immediate value into a floating-point\n\
register, so @code{TARGET_PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS} returns @code{NO_REGS} when\n\

If an insn has pseudos in it after register allocation, reload will go\n\

unconditionally.\n\
\n\
You need not include code to check for the numbers of fixed registers,\n\
because the allocation mechanism considers them to be always occupied.\n\
\n\
@cindex register pairs\n\
On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd\n\
register pairs.  You can implement that by defining this hook to reject\n\
odd register numbers for such modes.\n\
\n\
The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that the\n\
@samp{mov@var{mode}} instruction pattern support moves between the\n\
register and other hard register in the same class and that moving a\n\
value into the register and back out not alter it.\n\
\n\
Since the same instruction used to move @code{word_mode} will work for\n\
all narrower integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for\n\
this hook to distinguish between these modes, provided you define\n\
patterns @samp{movhi}, etc., to take advantage of this.  This is\n\
useful because of the interaction between @code{TARGET_HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK}\n\
and @code{TARGET_MODES_TIEABLE_P}; it is very desirable for all integer\n\
modes to be tieable.\n\
\n\
Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic.\n\
Often people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed only\n\
in floating point registers.  This is not true.  Any registers that\n\
can hold integers can safely @emph{hold} a floating point machine\n\
mode, whether or not floating arithmetic can be done on it in those\n\
registers.  Integer move instructions can be used to move the values.\n\
\n\
On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine\n\
modes may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the floating\n\
registers normalize any value stored in them, because storing a\n\
non-floating value there would garble it.  In this case,\n\
@code{TARGET_HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK} should reject fixed-point machine modes in\n\
floating registers.  But if the floating registers do not automatically\n\
normalize, if you can store any bit pattern in one and retrieve it\n\
unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode may go in a floating\n\
register, so you can define this hook to say so.\n\
\n\
The primary significance of special floating registers is rather that\n\
they are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic\n\
instructions.  However, this is of no concern to\n\
@code{TARGET_HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK}.  You handle it by writing the proper\n\
constraints for those instructions.\n\
\n\
On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to access,\n\
so that it is better to store a value in a stack frame than in such a\n\
register if floating point arithmetic is not being done.  As long as the\n\
floating registers are not in class @code{GENERAL_REGS}, they will not\n\
be used unless some pattern's constraint asks for one.",
