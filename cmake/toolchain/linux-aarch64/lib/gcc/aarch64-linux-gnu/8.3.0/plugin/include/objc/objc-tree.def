/* This tree is used to represent the expression 'object.property',
   where 'object' is an Objective-C object and 'property' is an
   Objective-C property.  Operand 0 is the object (the tree
   representing the expression), and Operand 1 is the property (the
   PROPERTY_DECL).  Operand 2 is the 'getter' call, ready to be used;
   we pregenerate it because it is hard to generate it properly later
   on.  Operand 3 records whether using the 'getter' call should
   generate a deprecation warning or not.

   A PROPERTY_REF tree needs to be transformed into 'setter' and
   'getter' calls at some point; at the moment this happens in two
   places:

     * if we detect that a modify expression is being applied to a
       PROPERTY_REF, then we transform that into a 'getter' call (this
       happens in build_modify_expr() or cp_build_modify_expr()).

    * else, it will remain as a PROPERTY_REF until we get to
      gimplification; at that point, we convert each PROPERTY_REF into
      a 'getter' call during ObjC/ObjC++ gimplify.  At that point, it
      is quite hard to build a 'getter' call, but we have already built
      it and we just need to swap Operand 2 in, and emit the deprecation
      warnings from Operand 3 if needed.

  Please note that when the Objective-C 2.0 "dot-syntax" 'object.component'
  is encountered, where 'component' is not a property but there are valid
  setter/getter methods for it, an artificial PROPERTY_DECL is generated
  and used in the PROPERTY_REF.  */
