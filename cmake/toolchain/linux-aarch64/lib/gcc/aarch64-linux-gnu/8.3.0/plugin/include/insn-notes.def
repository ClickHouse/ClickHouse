/* This file defines all the codes that may appear in the
   NOTE_LINE_NUMBER field of a NOTE insn for kinds of notes that are
   not line numbers.  Source files define DEF_INSN_NOTE appropriately
   before including this file.

   We are slowly removing the concept of insn-chain notes from the
   compiler.  Adding new codes to this file is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.
   If you think you need one, look for other ways to express what you
   mean, such as register notes or bits in the basic-block structure.  */
