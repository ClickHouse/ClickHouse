/* A C_MAYBE_CONST_EXPR, currently only used for C and Objective C,
   tracks information about constancy of an expression and VLA type
   sizes or VM expressions from typeof that need to be evaluated
   before the main expression.  It is used during parsing and removed
   in c_fully_fold.  C_MAYBE_CONST_EXPR_PRE is the expression to
   evaluate first, if not NULL; C_MAYBE_CONST_EXPR_EXPR is the main
   expression.  If C_MAYBE_CONST_EXPR_INT_OPERANDS is set then the
   expression may be used in an unevaluated part of an integer
   constant expression, but not in an evaluated part.  If
   C_MAYBE_CONST_EXPR_NON_CONST is set then the expression contains
   something that cannot occur in an evaluated part of a constant
   expression (or outside of sizeof in C90 mode); otherwise it does
   not.  */

/* An EXCESS_PRECISION_EXPR, currently only used for C and Objective
   C, represents an expression evaluated in greater range or precision
   than its type.  The type of the EXCESS_PRECISION_EXPR is the

   evaluated.  */
