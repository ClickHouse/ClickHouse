	- there is no a priori limit on number of text sections
	- pr_scale is declared as unsigned long (instead of "unsigned int")
	- pr_size is declared as size_t (instead of "unsigned int")
	- pr_off is declared as void * (instead of "__psunsigned_t")
	- the overflow bin (pr_base==0, pr_scale==2) can appear anywhere
	  in the profp array
	- PROF_FAST has no effect  */
