#ifndef _GNU_VERSIONS_H
#define	_GNU_VERSIONS_H	1

/* This file exists to define these few macros.  Each specifies a version
   number associated with the library interface of a piece of the C library
   which is also distributed with other GNU packages.  These pieces are
   both part of the GNU C library and also distributed with other GNU
   packages so those packages may use their facilities on systems lacking
   the GNU C library.  The source files for each piece surround all their
   code with `#ifndef ELIDE_CODE' after defining it with this:

   #define OBSTACK_INTERFACE_VERSION 1
   #if !defined (_LIBC) && defined (__GNU_LIBRARY__) && __GNU_LIBRARY__ > 1
   #include <gnu-versions.h>
   #if _GNU_OBSTACK_INTERFACE_VERSION == OBSTACK_INTERFACE_VERSION
   #define ELIDE_CODE
   #endif
   #endif

   This allows those one to avoid compiling those files when part of a GNU
   package not libc, on a system using a GNU C library that supports the
   same interface.

   Please preserve the format of the comments after each macro.  And
   remember, if any of these versions change, the libc.so major version
   number must change too (so avoid it)!  */
