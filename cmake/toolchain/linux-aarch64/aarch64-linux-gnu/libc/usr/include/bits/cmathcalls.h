/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <complex.h>, this
   file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
   usually are.

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME, (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME, (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.  */
