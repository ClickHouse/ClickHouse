# Embed a set of resource files into a resulting object file.
#
# Signature: `clickhouse_embed_binaries(TARGET <target> RESOURCE_DIR <dir> RESOURCES <resource> ...)
#
# This will generate a static library target named `<target>`, which contains the contents of
# each `<resource>` file. The files should be located in `<dir>`. <dir> defaults to
# ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}, and the resources may not be empty.
#
# Each resource will result in three symbols in the final archive, based on the name `<resource>`.
# These are:
#   1. `_binary_<name>_start`: Points to the start of the binary data from `<resource>`.
#   2. `_binary_<name>_end`: Points to the end of the binary data from `<resource>`.
#   2. `_binary_<name>_size`: Points to the size of the binary data from `<resource>`.
#
# `<name>` is a normalized name derived from `<resource>`, by replacing the characters "./-" with
# the character "_", and the character "+" with "_PLUS_". This scheme is similar to those generated
# by `ld -r -b binary`, and matches the expectations in `./base/common/getResource.cpp`.
