# This is a workaround for bug in llvm/clang,
# that does not produce .debug_aranges with LTO
#
# NOTE: this is a temporary solution, that should be removed after upgrading to
# clang-16/llvm-16.
#
# Refs: https://reviews.llvm.org/D133092

# NOTE: only -flto=thin is supported.
# NOTE: it is not possible to check was there -gdwarf-aranges initially or not.
