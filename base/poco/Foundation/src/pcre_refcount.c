/* This module contains the external function pcre_refcount(), which is an
auxiliary function that can be used to maintain a reference count in a compiled
pattern data block. This might be helpful in applications where the block is
shared by different users. */

/*************************************************
*           Maintain reference count             *
*************************************************/

/* The reference count is a 16-bit field, initialized to zero. It is not
possible to transfer a non-zero count from one host to a different host that
has a different byte order - though I can't see why anyone in their right mind
would ever want to do that!

Arguments:
  argument_re   points to compiled code
  adjust        value to add to the count

Returns:        the (possibly updated) count value (a non-negative number), or
                a negative error number
