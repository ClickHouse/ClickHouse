class Foundation_API Pipe
	/// This class implements an anonymous pipe.
	///
	/// Pipes are a common method of inter-process communication -
	/// on Unix, pipes are the oldest form of IPC.
	///
	/// A pipe is a half-duplex communication channel, which means
	/// that data only flows in one direction.
	/// Pipes have a read-end and a write-end. One process writes to
	/// the pipe and another process reads the data written by
	/// its peer. 
	/// Read and write operations are always synchronous. A read will
	/// block until data is available and a write will block until
	/// the reader reads the data.
	///
	/// The sendBytes() and readBytes() methods of Pipe are usually
	/// used through a PipeOutputStream or PipeInputStream and are
	/// not called directly.
	///
	/// Pipe objects have value semantics; the actual work is delegated
	/// to a reference-counted PipeImpl object.
