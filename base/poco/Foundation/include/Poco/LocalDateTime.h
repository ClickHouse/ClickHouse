class Foundation_API LocalDateTime
	/// This class represents an instant in local time
	/// (as opposed to UTC), expressed in years, months, days, 
	/// hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds based on the 
	/// Gregorian calendar.
	///
	/// In addition to the date and time, the class also 
	/// maintains a time zone differential, which denotes
	/// the difference in seconds from UTC to local time,
	/// i.e. UTC = local time - time zone differential.
	///
	/// Although LocalDateTime supports relational and arithmetic
	/// operators, all date/time comparisons and date/time arithmetics
	/// should be done in UTC, using the DateTime or Timestamp
	/// class for better performance. The relational operators
	/// normalize the dates/times involved to UTC before carrying out
	/// the comparison.
	///
	/// The time zone differential is based on the input date and
	/// time and current time zone. A number of constructors accept
	/// an explicit time zone differential parameter. These should
	/// not be used since daylight savings time processing is impossible
	/// since the time zone is unknown. Each of the constructors
	/// accepting a tzd parameter have been marked as deprecated and
	/// may be removed in a future revision.
