class Foundation_API PriorityNotificationQueue
	/// A PriorityNotificationQueue object provides a way to implement asynchronous
	/// notifications. This is especially useful for sending notifications
	/// from one thread to another, for example from a background thread to 
	/// the main (user interface) thread. 
	///
	/// The PriorityNotificationQueue is quite similar to the NotificationQueue class.
	/// The only difference to NotificationQueue is that each Notification is tagged
	/// with a priority value. When inserting a Notification into the queue, the
	/// Notification is inserted according to the given priority value, with 
	/// lower priority values being inserted before higher priority
	/// values. Therefore, the lower the numerical priority value, the higher
	/// the actual notification priority. 
	///
	/// Notifications are dequeued in order of their priority.
	/// 
	/// The PriorityNotificationQueue can also be used to distribute work from
	/// a controlling thread to one or more worker threads. Each worker thread
	/// repeatedly calls waitDequeueNotification() and processes the
	/// returned notification. Special care must be taken when shutting
	/// down a queue with worker threads waiting for notifications.
	/// The recommended sequence to shut down and destroy the queue is to
	///   1. set a termination flag for every worker thread
	///   2. call the wakeUpAll() method
	///   3. join each worker thread
	///   4. destroy the notification queue.
