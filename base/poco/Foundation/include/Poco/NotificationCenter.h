class Foundation_API NotificationCenter
	/// A NotificationCenter is essentially a notification dispatcher. 
	/// It notifies all observers of notifications meeting specific criteria.
	/// This information is encapsulated in Notification objects.
	/// Client objects register themselves with the notification center as observers of 
	/// specific notifications posted by other objects. When an event occurs, an object 
	/// posts an appropriate notification to the notification center. The notification  
	/// center invokes the registered method on each matching observer, passing the notification 
	/// as argument.
	///
	/// The order in which observers receive notifications is undefined. 
	/// It is possible for the posting object and the observing object to be the same.
	/// The NotificationCenter delivers notifications to observers synchronously. 
	/// In other words the postNotification() method does not return until all observers have 
	/// received and processed the notification. 
	/// If an observer throws an exception while handling a notification, the NotificationCenter
	/// stops dispatching the notification and postNotification() rethrows the exception.
	///
	/// In a multithreaded scenario, notifications are always delivered in the thread in which the 
	/// notification was posted, which may not be the same thread in which an observer registered itself.
	///
	/// The NotificationCenter class is basically a C++ implementation of the NSNotificationCenter class
	/// found in Apple's Cocoa (or OpenStep).
	///
	/// While handling a notification, an observer can unregister itself from the notification center,
	/// or it can register or unregister other observers. Observers added during a dispatch cycle
	/// will not receive the current notification.
	///
	/// The method receiving the notification must be implemented as
	///     void handleNotification(MyNotification* pNf);
	/// The handler method gets co-ownership of the Notification object
	/// and must release it when done. This is best done with an AutoPtr:
	///     void MyClass::handleNotification(MyNotification* pNf)
	///     {
	///         AutoPtr<MyNotification> nf(pNf);
	///         ...
	///     }
	///
	/// Alternatively, the NObserver class template can be used to register a callback
	/// method. In this case, the callback method receives the Notification in an
	/// AutoPtr and thus does not have to deal with object ownership issues:
	///     void MyClass::handleNotification(const AutoPtr<MyNotification>& pNf)
	///     {
	///         ...
	///     }
