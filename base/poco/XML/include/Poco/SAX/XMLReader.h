class XML_API XMLReader
	/// Interface for reading an XML document using callbacks. 
	/// XMLReader is the interface that an XML parser's SAX2 driver must 
	/// implement. This interface allows an application to set and
	/// query features and properties in the parser, to register event handlers 
	/// for document processing, and to initiate a document parse.
	/// All SAX interfaces are assumed to be synchronous: the parse methods must not 
	/// return until parsing is complete, and readers
	/// must wait for an event-handler callback to return before reporting the next event.
