	/// The Event interface is used to provide contextual information about an event
	/// to the handler processing the event. An object which implements the Event
	/// interface is generally passed as the first parameter to an event handler.
	/// More specific context information is passed to event handlers by deriving
	/// additional interfaces from Event which contain information directly relating
	/// to the type of event they accompany. These derived interfaces are also implemented
	/// by the object passed to the event listener.

		/// Used to indicate the EventTarget whose EventListeners are currently being 
		/// processed. This is particularly useful during capturing and bubbling.

	PhaseType eventPhase() const;
		/// Used to indicate which phase of event flow is currently being evaluated.

		/// If the event can bubble the value is true, else the value is false.

		/// value of 0 will be returned. Examples of epoch time are the time of the 
		/// system start or 0:0:0 UTC 1st January 1970.

		/// The stopPropagation method is used prevent further propagation of an 
		/// event during event flow. If this method is called by
		/// any EventListener the event will cease propagating through the tree. 
		/// The event will complete dispatch to all listeners on the
		/// current EventTarget before event flow stops. This method may be used 
		/// during any stage of event flow.

		/// If an event is cancelable, the preventDefault method is used to signify 
		/// that the event is to be canceled, meaning any default
		/// action normally taken by the implementation as a result of 
		/// the event will not occur. If, during any stage of event flow, the
		/// preventDefault method is called the event is canceled. Any default 
		/// action associated with the event will not occur. Calling
		/// this method for a non-cancelable event has no effect. Once 
		/// preventDefault has been called it will remain in effect throughout
		/// the remainder of the event's propagation. This method may be 
		/// used during any stage of event flow. 

	void initEvent(const XMLString& eventType, bool canBubble, bool isCancelable);
		/// The initEvent method is used to initialize the value of an 
		/// Event created through the DocumentEvent interface. This method
		/// may only be called before the Event has been dispatched via the 
		/// dispatchEvent method, though it may be called multiple
		/// times during that phase if necessary. If called multiple 
		/// times the final invocation takes precedence. If called from 
		/// a subclass of Event interface only the values specified in the 
		/// initEvent method are modified, all other attributes are left unchanged.
