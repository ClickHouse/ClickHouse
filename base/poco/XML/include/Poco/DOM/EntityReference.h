	/// EntityReference objects may be inserted into the structure model when an
	/// entity reference is in the source document, or when the user wishes to insert
	/// an entity reference. Note that character references and references to predefined
	/// entities are considered to be expanded by the HTML or XML processor so that
	/// characters are represented by their Unicode equivalent rather than by an
	/// entity reference. Moreover, the XML processor may completely expand references
	/// to entities while building the structure model, instead of providing EntityReference
	/// objects. If it does provide such objects, then for a given EntityReference
	/// node, it may be that there is no Entity node representing the referenced
	/// entity. If such an Entity exists, then the child list of the EntityReference
	/// node is the same as that of the Entity node.
	/// 
	/// As for Entity nodes, EntityReference nodes and all their descendants are
	/// readonly.
	/// 
	/// The resolution of the children of the EntityReference (the replacement value
	/// of the referenced Entity) may be lazily evaluated; actions by the user (such
	/// as calling the childNodes method on the EntityReference node) are assumed
	/// to trigger the evaluation.
