CMAKE Files contributed by Andrew J. P. Maclean <a.maclean@optusnet.com.au>


Put the following files in the directory where your source code is:
  CMakeLists.txt
  PocoConfig.cmake.

Edit CMakeLists.txt to include your source and header files. The sections of interest are:
# Add any source files here.
SET( EXE_SRCS
 "My File.cpp"
)
# Add any include files here.
SET( EXE_INCS
  "My File.h"
)

Then create a subdirectory called build.
In Linux:
cd build
ccmake ..
or
ccmake -GKDevelop3 ..
(This will set up everything so you can use KDevelop3).

In Windows:
run CMakeSetup.exe and set the source code directory and where to build the libraries.

If CMake cannot find Poco, you will see that the variable Poco_INCLUDE_DIR has the value Poco_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND. Just set this value to the top level direcotry of where the Poco includes are.

If there is a different version of Poco, you may have to add edit the variables SUFFIX_FOR_INCLUDE_PATH, and  SUFFIX_FOR_LIBRARY_PATH adding in the new Poco version in a similar manner to the existing ones in the file PocoConfig.cmake.

Finally:
In Linux
  Either type "make" or if you are using KDevelop, click on the <ProjectName>.kdevelop file.
In Windows just use your IDE or nmake if you use nmake.
