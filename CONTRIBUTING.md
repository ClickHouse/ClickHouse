## Legal Info

When you open your first pull-request to ClickHouse repo, a bot will invite you to accept ClickHouse Individual CLA (Contributor License Agreement). It is a simple few click process. For subsequent pull-requests the bot will check if you have already signed it and won't bother you again.

Optionally, to make contributions even more tight legally, your employer as a legal entity may want to sign a ClickHouse Corporate CLA with ClickHouse, Inc. If you're interested to do so, contact us at [legal@clickhouse.com](mailto:legal@clickhouse.com).

## Technical Info

We have a [developer's guide](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/development/developer_instruction/) for writing code for ClickHouse. Besides this guide, you can find [Overview of ClickHouse Architecture](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/development/architecture/) and instructions on how to build ClickHouse in different environments.

If you want to contribute to documentation, read the [Contributing to ClickHouse Documentation](docs/README.md) guide.
