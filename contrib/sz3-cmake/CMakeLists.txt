# SZ3 is still under development, it writes its current version into the serialized compressed data.
# Therefore, update SZ3 with care to avoid breaking existing persistencies.

# File contrib/sz3-cmake/SZ3/version.hpp was statically generated from version.hpp.in in contrib/sz3.
# It must be updated when the library is updated. Refer to contrib/sz3/README.md for that (section #Installation).
# Turn off ska hash because ska::unordered_map (this is inner hash map) doesn't work with UB sanitizer.
