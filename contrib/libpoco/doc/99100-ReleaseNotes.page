!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - Data::ODBC: UTF-16 Unicode is now directly mapped and recognized as type by ODBC.
    This may cause behavior different from previosu versions, especially with Any and 
    Dynamic::Var bindings.
    In this release, UTF-16 binding is only available for ODBC back end; although other 
    back ends will compile with UTF-16 strings bound, such binding attempt will throw 
    NotImplementedException at runtime. 
  - Please note that 1.5.x releases are development releases and not considered stable. Interfaces may
    change, and backwards compatibility with the stable 1.4 release series
    is not guaranteed. There may also be some rough edges. 
    The next stable release incorporating 1.5 features will be 1.6.

    series is not guaranteed. There may also be some rough edges.

  - Keywords for the Data library (now, use, into, etc.) now reside in Poco::Data::Keywords namespace.
  - Please note that 1.5.x releases are development releases and not considered stable. Interfaces may
    change, and backwards compatibility with the stable 1.4 release series
    is not guaranteed. There may also be some rough edges. 
    The next stable release incorporating 1.5 features will be 1.6.

!!!Release 1.4.2p1

!!Summary of Changes

  - On Linux, the RTLD_DEEPBIND option is no longer passed to dlopen(). 
    This change was introduced in 1.4.2 to solve a specific problem one customer 
    was having. Unfortunately, it leads to problems with RTTI.
  - It's now possible to pass flags (SHLIB_GLOBAL, SHLIB_LOCAL) to 
    Poco::SharedLibrary::load() (and the constructor implicitly calling load()), 
    controlling the mode flags (RTLD_GLOBAL, RTLD_LOCAL) passed to dlopen(). 
    On platforms not using dlopen(), these flags are ignored.
  - fixed SF# 3400267: Path_WIN32.cpp bug


!!!Release 1.4.2

!!Summary of Changes

  - added Poco::DateTimeFormat::ISO8601_FRAC_FORMAT
  - added new Poco::DateTimeFormatter and Poco::DateTimeParser format specifier:
    %s for seconds with optional fractions of a second
  - fixed a problem with ioctl() on BSD platforms (including OS X) where the 
    second argument to ioctl() is unsigned long instead of int, causing bad 
    things on a OS X 64-bit kernel.
  - fixed a potential endless loop when enumerating IPv6 network addresses 
    (reported by Laurent Carcagno)
  - new compile-time config option on Windows to set thread names in
    debugger. Enable with -DPOCO_WIN32_DEBUGGER_THREAD_NAMES. Available
    only in debug builds.
  - Cipher can now create Base64 and HexBinary encoded output without linefeeds 
    (suitable for use in cookies, etc.)
  - added Poco::Path::popFrontDirectory()
  - improved VxWorks support
  - IPv6 fixes: added proper scope id handling in IPAddress, SocketAddress
    and related classes.
  - Added Poco::Net::ServerSocket::bind6() which allows control over the
    IPPROTO_IPV6/IPV6_V6ONLY socket option.
  - Removed Poco::MD2Engine class due to licensing issues (the 
    license for the MD2 code from RSA only allows non-commercial
    use). Note that the MD4 and MD5 code from RSA does not have
    this issue.
  - fixed a Net HTTP client testsuite issue where some tests might
    have failed due to prematurely aborted connections by
    the HTTPTestServer.
  - Poco::Net::SocketAddress: when there is more than one address
    returned by a DNS lookup for a name, IPv4 addresses will be
    preferred to IPv6 ones.
  - Poco::Net::NetworkInterface::list() now also returns IPv4 interfaces on Windows when 
    built with -DPOCO_HAVE_IPv6
  - Poco::XML::XMLWriter: fixed a bug with attribute namespaces (no namespace prefix 
    written if attribute namespace is the same as element namespace)
  - fixed SF# 3378588: Mismatched new[]/delete (in RSAEncryptImpl and RSADecryptImpl)
  - fixed SF# 3212954 (OpenSSLInitializer::uninitialize() crash) and 
    SF# 3196862 (Static OpenSSLInitializer instance causes Windows deadlocks) by
    removing the static Poco::Crypto::OpenSSLInitializer instance. Automatic OpenSSL
    initialization is now done through Poco::Crypto::Cipher, Poco::Crypto::CipherKey, 
    Poco::Crypto::X509Certificate, Poco::Net::Context classes; however, it is still
    recommended to call Poco::Crypto::initializeCrypto() and 
    Poco::Crypto::uninitializeCrypto() early at application startup, and late at
    shutdown respectively (or Poco::Net::initializeSSL()/Poco::Net::uninitializeSSL()
    if the NetSSL library is used) to avoid multiple full OpenSSL init/uninit cycles
    during application runtime.
  - Poco::Logger now also support a symbolic log level "none"
    (for use with setLevel()) that disables logging completely
    for that Logger (equivalent to setLevel(0)).
  - Added experimental Android support, using the existing gmake-based
    build system.
  - fixed SF# 3288584: DateTimeFormatter link error
  - fixed SF# 3187117: Typo in InflatingInputStream doc

  - fixed SF# 3387258: _MAX_PATH used but unknown in Path_WIN32
  - fixed a problem in Poco::Crypto::RSAKeyImpl where direct access to the RSA in a 
    EVP_PKEY would no longer work in recent OpenSSL versions. Using EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA() 
    fixes the issue.
  - added Poco::Crypto::EncryptingInputStream, Poco::Crypto::EncryptingOutputStream, 
    Poco::Crypto::DecryptingInputStream and Poco::Crypto::DecryptingOutputStream.
  - fixed SF# 3148126: Poco::Net::HTTPSClientSession destructor throws an IOException
  - fixed SF# 3178098: Add constructor to Poco::TemporaryFile to specify directory
  - fixed SF# 3175310: Absolute path when device 
  - fixed SF# 3301207: Guided tour example contradicts apidoc (API doc was wrong)
  - Poco::Net::HTTPMessage::setContentLength() and Poco::Net::HTTPMessage::getContentLength() now
    use std::streamsize instead of int. This enables 64-bit Content-Length support at least
    on 64-bit platforms.
  - fixed SF# 3177530: Poco::TemporaryFile::tempName() + glob bug on xp
  - fixed SF# 3177372: Poco::FileChannel documentation inconsistency

    line argument for specifying a service description (together with /registerService)
  - added Poco::Util::WinService::setDescription() and 
    Poco::Util::WinService::getDescription()
  - fixed SF# 3155477: Incorrect URI path handling
  - fixed SF# 3309736: Extended Exception macros to set default exception code
    new macro is named POCO_DECLARE_EXCEPTION_CODE
  - added getter functions for modulus and exponents to Poco::Crypto::RSAKey.
  - added Poco::Net::SocketAddress::operator == () and 
    Poco::Net::SocketAddress::operator != ()
  - fixed SF# 3182746: IPAddress.cpp IPv6 bug on big-endian
  - fixed SF# 3196961: Unix daemon fails to loadConfiguration() if started from cwd
  - fixed SF# 3393700: NotificationCenter may call a removed observer and crash.
  - Reworked implementation of the events framework (Poco::BasicEvent and friends).
    The framework is now completely multithreading save (even in the case that
    an event subscriber object unsubscribes and is deleted while an event is
    being dispatched). Also, the restriction that any object can only register
    one delegate for each event has been removed. For most cases, dispatching
    events should be faster, as dispatching an event now needs less dynamic memory
    allocations.
  - fixed SF# 3178109: getNodeByPath() changes:
    getNodeByPath() and getNodeByPathNS() have been moved to Poco::XML::Node. 
    Furthermore, when invoked on a Poco::XML::Document, the behavior has changed
    so that the document element is now included when traversing the path (previously,
    traversal would start at the document element, now it starts at the document).
    The path expression can now start with a double-slash, which results in a recursive
    search for the path's first element in the DOM tree.
  - fixed SF# 3382935: String data being truncated using ODBC, and
    SF# 2921813: Wrong implementation of the ODBC string binding


!!!Release 1.4.1p1

!!Summary of Changes

  - Poco::Mutex is now a recursive mutex again on Linux
    (this was caused by an unfortunate feature test for
    PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE which did not work on Linux
    as PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE is an enum value and not
    a macro)
  - Poco::Net::SecureSocketImpl::abort() now only shuts
    down the underlying socket connection and does not free
    the SSL object, due to multithreading issues.


!!!Release 1.4.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - fixed SF# 3150223: Poco::BinaryReader cannot read std::vector correctly
  - fixed SF# 3146326: Poco::SharedMemory issue
  - made Poco::Net::HTTPSession::abort() virtual
  - added Poco::Net::SecureStreamSocket::abort() to immediately close
    a SSL/TLS connection without performing an orderly SSL/TLS shutdown.
  - fixed SF# 3148126: Poco::Net::HTTPSClientSession destructor (!) throws an IOException.
    Added try/catch block to Poco::Net::SecureSocketImpl destructor.
  - added additional constructor to Poco::Net::HTTPSClientSession, taking
    both a socket and a session object.
  - Poco::Net::HTTPSession::abort() now also can be used with a
    Poco::Net::HTTPSClientSession.
  - fixed SF# 3148045: make clean and distclean issues
  - changed Data library names on Unix/Linux platforms to
    match the names on Windows (PocoSQLite -> PocoDataSQLite,
    PocoMySQL -> PocoDataMySQL, PocoODBC -> PocoDataODBC)
  - added additional options to configure script
  - added additional documentation to Poco::Net::HTTPClientSession
  - Poco::Net::HTTPClientSession::receiveResponse() closes the connection 
    if an exception is thrown while reading the response header. 
    This ensures that a new connection will be set up for the next request 
    if persistent connections are used.
  - improved Poco::Net::MultipartDecoder performance by reading directly from streambuf
  - improved performance of Poco::Base64Encoder, Poco::Base64Decoder, 
    Poco::HexBinaryEncoder and Poco::HexBinaryDecoder by working directly with the 
    given stream's streambuf.
  - improved performance of MessageHeader::read() by reading directly from streambuf 
    instead of istream.
  - it is now possible to specify additional MIME part header fields
    for a MIME part through the Poco::Net::PartSource class.
  - upgraded SQLite to release 3.7.4
  - added experimental VxWorks support for VxWorks 5.5.1/Tornado 2.2 and
    newer. Please see the VxWorks Platform Notes in the reference documentation
    for more information. Currently, the VxWorks is untested; full support
    will be available in release 1.4.2.
  - fixed SF# 3165918: Poco::DynamicAny fails to convert from string to float
  - fixed SF# 3165910: Poco::Net::MessageHeader does not accept HTTP conforming header
  - made Poco::Task::cancel() virtual so that tasks can implement custom
    cancellation behavior.
  - added optional argument to Poco::Util::WinRegistryKey constructor
    to specify additional flags (in addition to KEY_READ and KEY_WRITE)
    for the samDesired argument of RegOpenKeyEx() or RegCreateKeyEx().
  - improved Poco::BasicEvent::notify() performance by avoiding an unnecessary heap
    allocation.  
  - added additional well-known port numbers to Poco::URI: rtsp, sip, sips, xmpp.
  - added Poco::Net::MediaType::matchesRange()
  - improved invalid socket handling: a Poco::Net::InvalidSocketException is 
    now thrown instead of an assertion when an operation is attempted on a closed or 
    otherwise uninitialized socket.


!!!Release 1.4.0

!!Summary of Changes

  - Poco::Net::SSLManager: documentation fixes, code cleanup
  - Poco::Net::SSLManager: renamed PrivateKeyPassPhrase event to PrivateKeyPassphraseRequired
  - added Poco::Net::HTTPServerRequestImpl::socket() to get access to the underlying socket
  - added Poco::Net::Socket::secure() to find out whether a given socket supports SSL/TLS
  - added Poco::Net::SecureStreamSocket::havePeerCertificate()
  - NetSSL: added support for turning off extended certificate validation (hostname matching)
  - fixed SF# 2941228: Poco::Net::ICMPClient::ping() issues on Mac OS X
  - fixed SF# 2941231: Poco::Net::ICMPEventArgs out of bounds array access
  - added PageCompiler sample
  - added missing newline at end of xmlparse.c
  - Poco::Glob can now be used with an empty pattern which will match nothing (patch from Kim Graesman)
  - added support for HTTP proxy authentication (Basic authentication only)
  - fixed SF# 2958959: Poco::XML::XMLWriter must encode CR, LF and TAB in attribute values as character entities.
  - Poco::Net::HTMLForm now supports PUT requests as well (see <http://pocoproject.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=2163&p=3930#p3930>)
  - fixed SF# #2970521: Poco::FileOutputStream and file permissions.
    (also fixed in File class)
  - removed an unused (and wrong) default parameter from EventImpl constructor for WIN32.
  - added full support for session caching to NetSSL_OpenSSL
  - fixed SF# 2984454: Poco::Util::Timer::scheduleAtFixedRate() works incorrectly
  - fixed a bug in Poco::Util::Timer that could lead to high CPU load if
    the system clock is moved forward.
  - added "system.nodeId" property to Poco::Util::SystemConfiguration
  - added a note to Poco::Util::ServerApplication documentation regarding
    creation of threads
  - added Poco::Net::IPAddress::broadcast() and Poco::Net::IPAddress::wildcard() to 
    create broadcast (255.255.255.255) and wildcard (0.0.0.0) addresses.
  - fixed SF# 2916154: Poco::Net::IPAddress::isLoopback() only works for 127.0.0.1.
  - added build configuration for iPhone Simulator
  - GNU Make based build system provides new variables: POCO_HOST_BINDIR, POCO_HOST_BINPATH,
    POCO_HOST_LIBDIR, POCO_HOST_LIBPATH and POCO_TARGET_* equivalents.
  - Poco::Util::Application::initialize() and Poco::Util::Application::uninitialize() will now be called from within run().
    This solves various issues with uninitialize() not being called, or being called inappropriately 
    from the Application destructor.
    Please note that this change will break applications that use the Application class,
    but only call init() and not run().
  - added /startup option to specify startup mode for Windows services (automatic or manual)
  - fixed SF# 2967354: SecureSocketImpl shutdown/close problem
  - fixed SF# 3006340: LinearHashTable grows even if key already exists
  - fixed a particularly nasty Windows error handling issue that manifested itself on WinCE: 
    WSAGetLastError() would be called after a std::string was created. The string creation could result 
    in a heap operation which called a Windows API to allocate memory. This would reset the 
    GetLastError() error code. Since WSAGetLastError() is just an alias for GetLastError(), the actual 
    error code from the socket operation would be lost.
  - upgraded SQLite to 3.7.3
  - added --header-prefix option to PageCompiler
  - fixed SF# 3003875: SQLite data binding is broken
  - fixed SF# 2993988: Issue with multiple calls to open()/close() on File*Stream
  - fixed SF# 2990256: Poco::Net::HTMLForm and file uploads
  - fixed SF# 2969227: Poco::DateTimeParser bug
  - fixed SF# 2966698: Socket connect with timeout issue
  - fixed SF# 2981041: Bind NULL to a query (patch supplied)
  - fixed SF# 2961419: Poco::UTF8Encoding::convert() doesn't work properly in DEBUG mode
  - fixed SF# 2957068: Timeout value not picked up by proxy in Poco::Net::HTTPSClientSession
  - fixed NetSSL_OpenSSL test runner for Poco::Util::Application class changes
  - Poco::AbstractEvent, Poco::AbstractCache and related classes now accept a Mutex class as additional template argument.
    Poco::NullMutex can be used if no synchronization is desired.
  - Added Poco::AbstractEvent::empty() to check whether an event has registered delegates.
  - Poco::URI now correctly handles IPv6 addresses.
  - Added Poco::Nullable class template.
  - Added Poco::NullMutex, a no-op mutex to be used as template argument for template classes
    taking a mutex policy argument.
  - Poco::XML::XMLWriter: fixed a namespace handling issue that occured with startPrefixMapping() and endPrefixMapping()
  - Poco::Net::Context now allows for loading certificates and private keys from Poco::Crypto::X509Certificate objects 
    and Poco::Crypto::RSAKey objects.
  - Poco::Crypto::RSAKey no longer uses temporary files for stream operations. Memory buffers are used instead.
  - fixed SF# 2957865: added Poco::UUID::tryParse()
  - All Zip classes now use Poco::File[Input|Output]Stream instead of std::[i|o]fstream. 
    UTF-8 filenames will now be handled correctly on Windows.
  - fixed SF# 2902029: zlib flush support (Z_SYNC_FLUSH)
  - added Poco::TextBufferIterator class
  - fixed SF# 2977249: Use epoll instead select under Linux
    Poco::Net::Socket::select() and Poco::Net::Socket::poll() will use epoll under Linux if the Net library is compiled
    with -DPOCO_HAVE_FD_EPOLL. This is the default for the Linux build configuration (but not for
    the various build configurations targeting embedded Linux platforms).
  - fixed SF# 2941664: Memory leak in Poco::DeflatingStream with zero-length streams (also fixed some other potential, 
    but unlikely, memory leaks)
  - fixed SF# 2946457: added Poco::Net::RejectCertificateHandler
  - fixed SF# 2946621: Poco::Path bug with POCO_WIN32_UTF8
  - fixed SF# 2929805: Environment::nodeId() does not work if no eth0 device exists
  - Poco::Environment::nodeId() no longer throws if no hardware ethernet address can be determined. 
    It returns an all-zero address instead.
  - Added additional classification functions to Poco::Unicode class; made classification functions inline.
  - added Poco::Ascii class for ASCII character classification.
    Methods of the Ascii class are now used instead of the
    standard library functions (std::isspace(), etc.) due to
    possible inconsistent results or assertions when the
    standard library functions are used with character codes
    outside the ASCII range.
  - Poco::Net::MailMessage: fixed a bug in StringPartHandler that resulted in incorrect handling of non-ASCII data if 
    char is signed.
  - Improved Poco::Net::SMTPClientSession compatibility with various mail servers when using AUTH_LOGIN authentication.
  - Added CRAM-SHA1 support to Poco::Net::SMTPClientSession
  - Poco::Net::SMTPClientSession now also supports login with AUTH PLAIN.
  - Added Poco::Net::SecureSMTPClientSession class, supporting STARTTLS for secure SMTP connections.
  - fixed an issue with SharedMemory on POSIX systems, where a shared memory region would be deleted 
    despite the server flag set to true (see http://pocoproject.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=3494).
  - PageCompiler: added a new page context directive, to allow passing custom context objects to the
    request handler.
  - fixed Poco::Net::StreamSocketImpl::sendBytes() for non-blocking sockets
  - added Poco::Net::DialogSocket::receiveRawBytes(), which should be used instead of receiveBytes() due to internal 
    buffering by DialogSocket.
  - Poco::XML::DOMParser: FEATURE_WHITESPACE has been renamed to FEATURE_FILTER_WHITESPACE (which now matches the underlying URI)
    and is now handled correctly (previously we did the exact reverse thing)
  - added Poco::Util::AbstractConfiguration::remove() to remove a configuration property; added removeRaw() implementations 
    to all implementations (contributions by Daniel Hobi and Alexey Shults).
  - fixed NetSSL_OpenSSL compilation error on Windows with OpenSSL 1.0
  - Added optional FIPS mode support to NetSSL_OpenSSL (contributed by Lior Okman).
    If OpenSSL has been configured and built with FIPS support, then FIPS support can
    be enabled by calling Poco::Crypto::OpenSSLInitializer::enableFIPSMode(true); or
    by setting the fips property in the OpenSSL configuration to true (see Poco::Net::SSLManager
    for details).
  - fixed SF# 3031530: Ping and possible no timeout
  - added Poco::Net::SocketReactor::onBusy(), called whenever at least one notification will
    be dispatched.
  - fixed SF# 3034863: Compiler warning in Net/IPAddress.h with poco 1.3.2
  - added support for CRAM-SHA1 authentication to Poco::Net::SMTPClientSession
  - Poco::format(): arguments can now be addressed by their index, e.g. %[2]d
  - Poco::Util::Timer::cancel() now accepts an optional boolean argument.
    If true is passed, cancel() waits until the task queue has been purged.
    Otherwise, it returns immediately and works asynchronously, as before.
  - Poco::Net::HTTPServerResponse::redirect() now accepts an optional additional
    argument to specify the HTTP status code for the redirection.       
  - fixed a warning (BinaryReader.cpp) and error (ThreadLocal.cpp) in Foundation when compiling with Visual Studio 2010
  - fixed a wrong exception in Poco::Net::POP3ClientSession
  - Poco::Net::FTPClientSession and Poco::Net::SMTPClientSession now set the error code in exceptions they throw
  - fixed a potential race condition with terminating a Windows service based on Poco::Util::ServerApplication
  - fixed a bug in global build configuration file: explicitly setting POCO_CONFIG did not work on Solaris platforms,
    as it was always overridden by the automatically determined configuration.
  - Added support for MinGW cross builds on Linux.
  - Changed location of statically linked build products in the gmake-based build system.
    Statically linked executables are now in bin/$(OSNAME)/$(OSARCH)/static and no longer
    have the _s suffix
  - The POCO_VERSION macro now is in its own header file, "Poco/Version.h". It is no longer
    available through "Poco/Foundation.h".
  - added Poco::Net::HTTPCookie::escape() and Poco::Net::HTTPCookie::unescape().
  - fixed SF# 3021173: Poco::Thread (POSIX) returns uninitialised value for OS priority
  - fixed SF# 3040870: Poco::ThreadPool has no function to get assigned name
  - fixed SF# 3044303: Can't use own config file on Solaris & OSARCH_64BITS ignored
  - fixed SF# 2943896: Poco::AsyncChannel::log() blocks
  - fixed a bug in Poco::Util::WinRegistryKey::getInt():
    The size variable passed to RegQueryValueExW() should be initialized to the size 
    of the output buffer.
  - Added rudimentary support for compiling with Clang 2.0 (Xcode 4) on Mac OS X.
  - New build configurations for Mac OS X: Darwin32 and Darwin64 for explicit
    32-bit and 64-bit builds. Note that the default Darwin build configuration 
    will build 64-bit on Snow Leopard and 32-bit on Leopard, but will always place
    build products in Darwin/i386. The new Darwin32 and Darwin64 configurations
    will use the correct directories.
  - fixed SF# 3051598: Bug in URL encoding
  - Poco::ThreadPool::stopAll() (and thus also the destructor) will now wait for each
    pooled thread to terminate before returning. This fixes an issue with creating
    and orderly shutting down a thread pool in a plugin. Previously, a pooled thread
    in a thread pool created by a dynamically loaded library might still be running
    when the plugin's shared library was unloaded, resulting in Bad Things happening.
    This can now no longer happen. As a downside, a pooled thread that fails to
    finish will block stopAll() and the destructor forever.
  - NetSSL_OpenSSL: for a Poco::Net::SecureStreamSocket, available() now returns the number of bytes that 
    are pending in the SSL buffer (SSL_pending()), not the actual socket buffer.
  - Added Poco::Net::HTTPClientSession::secure() to check for a secure connection.
  - Poco::Net::HTTPRequest::setHost() now does not include the port number in the Host header 
    if it's either 80 or 443.
  - log messages can now optionally include source file path and line number
  - Poco::PatternFormatter can format source file path and line number (%U, %u)
  - logging macros (poco_information(), etc.) now use __LINE__ and __FILE__
  - new logging macros that incorporate Poco::format(): poco_information_f1(logger, format, arg) with up to 4 arguments
  - added Poco::Net::HTTPSession::attachSessionData() and Poco::Net::HTTPSession::sessionData()
    to attach arbitrary data to a HTTP session.
  - added additional constructors to zlib stream classes that allow passing
    a windowBits parameter to the underlying zlib library.
  - fixed a potential error handling issue in Poco::Net::SecureSocketImpl.
  - fixed SF# 3110272: Poco::Crypto::RSACipherImpl bug.
  - fixed SF# 3081677: Poco::Util::ConfigurationView's getRaw not retrieving xml attributes.
  - added basic support for Canonical XML and better pretty-printing support to Poco::XML::XMLWriter.
  - Poco::Util::AbstractConfiguration now supports events fired when changing or
    removing properties.
  - XML: added support for finding DOM nodes by XPath-like
    expressions. Only a very minimal subset of XPath is supported.
    See Poco::XML::Element::getNodeByPath(), Poco::XML::Element::getNodeByPathNS()
    and the same methods in Poco::XML::Document.
  - Poco::Timer: If the callback takes longer to execute than the
    timer interval, the callback function will not be called until the next
    proper interval. The number of skipped invocations since the last
    invocation will be recorded and can be obtained by the callback
    by calling skipped().
  - Poco::BinaryReader and Poco::BinaryWriter now support reading and
    writing std::vectors of the supported basic types. Also, strings
    can now be written in a different encoding (a Poco::TextEncoding
    can be optionally passed to the constructor).
  - Windows Embedded CE (5.0 and newer) is now a supported platform.
  - Poco::UUID::nil() and Poco::UUID::isNil() have been renamed to
    Poco::UUID::null() and Poco::UUID::isNull(), respectively, to avoid
    issues with Objective-C++ projects on Mac OS X and iOS where nil is
    a system-provided macro.
  - Crypto bugfixes: Poco::Crypto::RSACipherImpl now pads every block of data, not just the 
    last (or last two).
  - Improved Crypto testsuite by adding new tests.
  - Added new Visual Studio project configurations: debug_static_mt and release_static_mt
    (linking with static runtime libraries). The existing configurations debug_static
    and release_static have been renamed to debug_static_md and release_static_md, respectively.
    The suffixes of the static libraries have also changed. The static_md configurations
    now build libraries with suffixes md[d], while the libraries built by the static_mt
    configurations have mt[d] suffixes.
  - Added Visual Studio project files for 64-bit builds.
  - Added Visual Studio 2010 project files.
  - Removed the use of local static objects in various methods due to
    their construction not being threadsafe (and thus leading to
    potential race conditions) on Windows/Visual C++.
  - Fixed some warning on 64-bit Windows builds.
  - The names of the Data connector libraries have changed. They are now
    named PocoDataMySQL, PocoDataODBC and PocoDataSQLite.
  - fixed SF# 3125498: Linux NetworkInterface::list() doesn't return IPv6 IPs
  - fixed SF# 3125457: IPv6 IPAddress tests are wrong
  - Added initialization functions for the NetSSL_OpenSSL and Crypto libraries.
    These should be called instead of relying on automatic initialization,
    implemented with static initializer objects, as this won't work with
    statically linked executables (where the linker won't include the
    static initializer object).
    The functions are Poco::Crypto::initializeCrypto(), Poco::Crypto::uninitializeCrypto(),
    Poco::Net::initializeSSL() and Poco::Net::uninitializeSSL().
    Applications using Crypto and/or NetSSL should call these methods appropriately at
    program startup and shutdown.
    Note: In release 1.3.6, similar functions have been added to the Net library.


!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - The behavior of Poco::Timer has been changed for the case when
    the callback function takes longer to execute than the given
    timer interval. In this case, the missed intervals are counted
    and the next callback will be at the next proper interval.
  - Poco::XML::DOMParser: FEATURE_WHITESPACE has been renamed to FEATURE_FILTER_WHITESPACE 
    (which now matches the underlying URI)
    and is now handled correctly (previously we did the exact reverse thing)
  - Poco::UUID::nil() and Poco::UUID::isNil() have been renamed to
    Poco::UUID::null() and Poco::UUID::isNull(), respectively, to avoid
    issues with Objective-C++ projects on Mac OS X and iOS where nil is
    a system-provided macro.
  - The names of the Data connector libraries have changed. They are now
    named PocoDataMySQL, PocoDataODBC and PocoDataSQLite.
  - The existing Visual Studio build configurations debug_static
    and release_static have been renamed to debug_static_md and 
    release_static_md, respectively. Also, the suffixes of the static
    library names have changed to match usual conventions.
  - New static initialization functions for the Crypto and NetSSL_OpenSSL libraries
    have been added. These should be called instead of relying on automatic initialization,
    implemented with static initializer objects, as this won't work with
    statically linked executables (where the linker won't include the
    static initializer object).
    The functions are Poco::Crypto::initializeCrypto(), Poco::Crypto::uninitializeCrypto(),
    Poco::Net::initializeSSL() and Poco::Net::uninitializeSSL().
    Applications using Crypto and/or NetSSL should call these methods appropriately at
    program startup and shutdown.
    Note: In release 1.3.6, similar functions have been added to the Net library.


!!!Release 1.3.6p2

  - fixed SF# 2919461: Context ignores parameter cypherList
  - removed an unused enum from RSACipherImpl.cpp (Crypto)
  - integrated a new expat patch for CVE-2009-3560.

    class now makes sure that OpenSSL is properly initialized.
  - updated iPhone build configuration (contributed by Martin York)
  - fixed SF# 1815124 (reopened): XML Compile failed on VS7.1 with
    XML_UNICODE_WCHAR_T

    bundled ones (-DPOCO_UNBUNDLED, configure --unbundled)
  - fixed SF# 2911407: Add sh4 support
  - fixed SF# 2912746: RSAKey::EXP_LARGE doesn't work
  - fixed SF# 2904119: abstractstrategy uses std::set but do not includes it
  - fixed SF# 2909946: localtime NULL pointer
  - fixed SF# 2914986: potential expat DoS security issues (CVE-2009-3560 and CVE-2009-3720)
  - fixed SF# 2916305: SSL Manager crashes
  - fixed SF# 2903676: Tuple TypeHander does not handle composites.


!!!Release 1.3.6

!!Summary of Changes

  - added Environment::processorCount()
  - added POCO_VERSION macro to Poco/Foundation.h
  - fixed SF# 2807527: Poco::Timer bug for long startInterval/periodic interval
  - fixed a bug similar to SF# 2807527 in Poco::Util::Timer.
  - fixed SF# 2795395: Constructor doesn't treat the params "key" and "iv"
  - fixed SF# 2804457: DateTime::checkLimit looks wrong
  - fixed SF# 2804546: DateTimeParser requires explicit RFC1123 format
  - added ReleaseArrayPolicy to Poco::SharedPtr
  - upgraded to SQLite 3.6.20
  - fixed SF# 2782709: Missing semicolons in "Logger.h" convenience
  - fixed SF# 2526407: DefaultStrategy.h ++it instead of it++ in a loop
  - fixed SF# 2502235: Poco STLPort patch
  - fixed SF# 2186643: Data::Statement::reset() not implemented in 1.3.3
  - fixed SF# 2164227: Allow File opened read only by FileInputSteam to be writable
  - fixed SF# 2791934: use of char_traits::copy in BufferedStreamBuf::underflow
  - fixed SF# 2807750: Support additional SQL types in SQLite
  - fixed documentation bugs in Timed/PriorityNotificationQueue
  - fixed SF# 2828401: Deadlock in SocketReactor/NotificationCenter (also fixes patch# 1956490)
    NotificationCenter now uses a std::vector internally instead of a std::list, and the mutex is
    no longer held while notifications are sent to observers.
  - fixed SF# 2835206: File_WIN32 not checking aganist INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE
  - fixed SF# 2841812: Posix ThreadImpl::sleepImpl throws exceptions on EINTR
  - fixed SF# 2839579: simple DoS for SSL TCPServer, HTTPS server
    No SSL handshake is performed during accept() - the handshake is delayed until
    sendBytes(), receiveBytes() or completeHandshake() is called for the first time.
    This also allows for better handshake and certificate validation when using
    nonblocking connections.
  - fixed SF# 2836049: Possible handle leak in FileStream
    If sync() fails, close() now simply set's the stream's bad bit.
    In any case, close() closes the file handle/descriptor.   
  - fixed SF# 2814451: NetSSL: receiveBytes crashes if socket is closed
  - added a workaround for Vista service network initialization issue
    (an Windows service using the Net library running under Vista will
    crash in the call to WSAStartup() done in NetworkInitializer).
    Workaround is to call WSAStartup() in the application's main().
    Automatic call to WSAStartup() in the Net library can now be disabled 
    by compiling Net with -DPOCO_NET_NO_AUTOMATIC_WSASTARTUP. Also
    the new Poco::Net::initializeNetwork() and Poco::Net::uninitializeNetwork()
    functions can be used to call WSAStartup() and WSACleanup(), respectively,
    in a platform-independent way (on platforms other than Windows, these
    functions will simply do nothing).
  - added VCexpress build script support (contributed by Jolyon Wright)
  - fixed SF# 2851052: Poco::DirectoryIterator copy constructor is broken
  - fixed SF# 2851197: IPAddress ctor throw keyword missing
  - added Poco::ProtocolException
  - PageCompiler improvements: new tags, support for buffered output, etc.
  - better error reporting in Data MySQL connector (patch #2881270 by Jan "HanzZ" Kaluza)
  - fixed SF# 1892462: FTPClient:Choose explicitely between EPSV and PASV
  - fixed SF# 2806365: Option for PageCompiler to write output to different dir 
  - fixed a documentation bug (wrong sample code) in Process::launch() documentation
  - added --header-output-dir option to PageCompiler

  - fixed #0000092: ServerApplication::waitForTerminationRequest(), SIGINT and GDB.
    Poco::Util::ServerApplication::waitForTerminationRequest() no longer registers a
    signal handler for SIGINT if the environment variable POCO_ENABLE_DEBUGGER
    is defined.
  - fixed SF# 2896070: Poco::Net::Context with non-ASCII paths
  - added Unicode Surrogate support to Poco::UTF16Encoding.

    and uses the LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH if an absolute path is specified. This will
    add the directory containing the library to the search path for DLLs that the
    loaded library depends upon.
  - Mac OS X build settings now match those used by default Xcode projects, making linking the 
    POCO libs to Xcode projects easier
  - Replaced use of std::valarray in Poco::Net::ICMPEventArgs with std::vector due to issues with 
    std::valarray together with STDCXX debug mode on OS X


!!!Release 1.3.5

!!Summary of Changes

  - fixed SF# 2779410: Poco::Data::ODBC::HandleException impovement
  - fixed wrong exception text for Poco::UnhandledException
  - Fixed a problem with SSL shutdown that causes clients (web browsers)

  - fixed SF# 2465794: HTTPServerRequestImpl memory leak
  - fixed SF# 2583934: Zip: No Unix permissions set
  - the NetSSL_OpenSSL library has been heavily refactored
  - added NumberFormatter::append*() and DateTimeFormatter::append() functions
  - use NumberFormatter::append() and DateTimeFormatter::append() instead of format() where 
    it makes sense to gain some performance
  - added system.dateTime and system.pid to Poco::Util::SystemConfiguration
  - added %F format specifier (fractional seconds/microseconds) to DateTimeFormatter,
    DateTimeParser and PatternFormatter.
  - fixed SF# 2630476: Thread_POSIX::setStackSize() failure with g++ 4.3
  - fixed SF# 2679279: Handling of -- option broken
  - added compile options to reduce memory footprint of statically linked applications 
    by excluding various classes from automatically being linked.
    See the POCO_NO_* macros in Poco/Config.h.
  - fixed SF# 2644940: on Windows the COMPUTER-NAME and the HOSTNAME can be different
  - added DNS::hostName() function	
  - added build configuration for iPhone (using Apple's SDK)
  - basic support for AIX 5.x/xlC 8
  - fixed a bug resulting in a badly formatted exception message with IOException 
    thrown due to a socket-related error
  - fixed SF# 2644718: NetworkInterface name conflict in MinGW
  - added a missing #include to CryptoTransform.h
  - fixed SF# 2635377: HTTPServer::HTTPServer should take AutoPtr<HTTPServerParams>
  - replaced plain pointers with smart pointers in some interfaces
  - upgraded to sqlite 3.6.13
  - improved Data::SQLite error reporting
  - Poco::Glob now works with UTF-8 encoded strings and supports case-insensitive comparison.
    This also fixes SF# 1944831: Glob::glob on windows should be case insensitve
  - added Twitter client sample to Net library
  - Fixed SF# 2513643: Seg fault in Poco::UTF8::toLower on 64-bit Linux
  - Poco::Data::SessionPool: the janitor can be disabled by specifying a zero idle time.
  - added Poco::Data::SessionPool::customizeSession()
  - added support for different SQLite transaction modes (DEFERRED, IMMEDIATE, EXCLUSIVE)
  - fixed a few wrong #if POCO_HAVE_IPv6 in the Net library
  - added support for creating an initialized, but unconnected StreamSocket.
  - added File::isDevice()
  - added family() member function to SocketAddress,
  - Data::SQLite: added support for automatic retries if the database is locked
  - XMLConfiguration is now writable
  - fixed an IPv6 implementation for Windows bug in HostEntry
  - Timer class improvement: interval between callback is no longer influenced by the 
    time needed to execute the callback.
  - added PriorityNotificationQueue and TimedNotificationQueue classes to Foundation. 
    These are variants of the NotificationQueue class that support priority and 
    timestamp-tagged notifications.
  - added Poco::Util::Timer class. This implements a timer that can schedule different 
    tasks at different times, using only one thread.
  - the signatures of Poco::NotificationQueue and Poco::NotificationCenter member functions 
    have been changed to accept a Poco::Notification::Ptr instead of Poco::Notification* 
    to improve exception safety. This change should be transparent and fully backwards 
    compatible. The signature of the methods returning a Poco::Notification* have not been 
    changed for backwards compatibility. It is recommended, that any Notification* obtained 
    should be immediately assigned to a Notification::Ptr.	
  - SQLite::SessionImpl::isTransaction() now uses sqlite3_get_autocommit() to find out 
    about the transaction state.
  - improved SQLite data type mapping
  - refactored Crypto library to make it independent from NetSSL_OpenSSL.
  - added support for RSA-MD5 digital signatures to Crypto library.
  - removed SSLInitializer from NetSSL library (now moved to Crypto library)
  - added build configs for static libraries to Crypto library
  - OpenSSL now depends on Crypto library (which makes more sense than
    vice versa, as it was before). Poco::Net::X509Certificate is now
    a subclass of Poco::Crypto::X509Certificate (adding the verify()
    member function) and the Poco::Net::SSLInitializer class was 
    moved to Poco::Crypto::OpenSSLInitializer.		  
  - added build configs for static libraries to Zip
  - added batch mode to CppUnit::WinTestRunner.
    WinTestRunnerApp supports a batch mode, which runs the
    test using the standard text-based TestRunner from CppUnit.
    To enable batch mode, start the application with the "/b"
    or "/B" command line argument. Optionally, a path to a file
    where the test output will be written to may be given:
    "/b:<path>" or "/B:<path>".
    When run in batch mode, the exit code of the application
    will denote test success (0) or failure (1).
  - testsuites now also work for static builds on Windows
  - The IPv6 support for Windows now basically works (Net library compiled with POCO_HAVE_IPv6)
  - fixed a potential error when shutting down openssl in a statically linked application
  - added static build configs to Data library
  - added Poco::AtomicCounter class, which uses OS-specific APIs for atomic (thread-safe) 
    manipulation of counter values.
  - Poco::RefCountedObject and Poco::SharedPtr now use Poco::AtomicCounter for 
    reference counting
  - fixed SF# 2765569: LoadConfiguration failing from current directory


!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - Some methods that have previously taken a plain pointer (to a reference counted object)
    as argument now take a Poco::AutoPtr instead. This shouldn't cause any problems for
    properly written code. Examples are Poco::NotificationCenter, Poco::NotificationQueue
    and Poco::Net::HTTPServer.
  - Poco::Glob now works with and assumes UTF-8 encoded strings.
  - Poco::Timer: the interval between callbacks is no longer influenced by the 
    time needed to execute the callback.
  - The Crypto and NetSSL_OpenSSL libraries have been refactored. NetSSL_OpenSSL
    now depends on the Crypto library (previously, it was vice versa).
  

!!!Release 1.3.3

!!Summary of Changes

  - Threads now have optional user-settable stack size (if the OS supports that feature)
  - Events now support simplified delegate syntax based on delegate function template.
    See Poco::AbstractEvent documentation for new syntax.
  - Cache supports new access expire strategy.
  - Upgraded to SQLite 3.6.2
  - Upgraded to PCRE 7.8
  - added HttpOnly support to Poco::Net::HTTPCookie
  - NetworkInterface now has displayName() member (useful only on Windows)
  - Poco::Util::WinRegistryKey now has a read-only mode
  - Poco::Util::WinRegistryKey::deleteKey() can now recursively delete registry keys
  - Poco::File::created() now returns 0 if the creation date/time is not known, as 
    it's the case on most Unix platforms (including Linux). 
    On FreeBSD and Mac OS X, it returns the real creation time.
  - Time interval based log file rotation (Poco::FileChannel) now works
    correctly. Since there's no reliable and portable way to find out the creation 
    date of a file (Windows has the tunneling "feature", most Unixes don't provide 
    the creation date), the creation/rotation date of the log file is written into 
    the log file as the first line.
  - added Environment::nodeId() for obtaining the Ethernet address of the system
    (this is now also used by UUIDGenerator - the corresponding code from UUIDGenerator
    was moved into Environment)
  - added a release policy argument to SharedPtr template
  - Socket::select() will no longer throw an InvalidArgumentException
    on Windows when called with no sockets at all. If all three socket
    sets are empty, Socket::select() will return 0 immediately.
  - SocketReactor::run() now catches exceptions and reports them via
    the ErrorHandler.
  - SocketReactor has a new IdleNotification, which will be posted when
    the SocketReactor has no sockets to handle.
  - added referenceCount() method to Poco::SharedPtr.
  - POCO now builds with GCC 4.3 (but there are some stupid warnings:
    "suggest parentheses around && within ||".
  - Solution and project files for Visual Studio 2008 are included

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

The (now deprecated) Poco::HashFunction class template has been changed in an 
incompatible way. The member function formerly named hash() is now the function
call operator. If you have defined your own HashFunction classes,
you have to update your code. Sorry for the inconvenience.

On Windows, POCO now builds with Unicode/UTF-8 support 
(POCO_WIN32_UTF8) enabled by default. If you need the previous (1.2)
behavior, remove the corresponding #define from Poco/Config.h
