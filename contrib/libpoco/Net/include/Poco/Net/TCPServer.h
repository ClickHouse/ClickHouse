class Net_API TCPServer: public Poco::Runnable
	/// This class implements a multithreaded TCP server.
	///
	/// The server uses a ServerSocket to listen for incoming
	/// connections. The ServerSocket must have been bound to
	/// an address before it is passed to the TCPServer constructor.
	/// Additionally, the ServerSocket must be put into listening
	/// state before the TCPServer is started by calling the start()
	/// method.
	///
	/// The server uses a thread pool to assign threads to incoming
	/// connections. Before incoming connections are assigned to
	/// a connection thread, they are put into a queue.
	/// Connection threads fetch new connections from the queue as soon
	/// as they become free. Thus, a connection thread may serve more
	/// than one connection.
	///
	/// As soon as a connection thread fetches the next connection from
	/// the queue, it creates a TCPServerConnection object for it
	/// (using the TCPServerConnectionFactory passed to the constructor)
	/// and calls the TCPServerConnection's start() method. When the
	/// start() method returns, the connection object is deleted.
	///
	/// The number of connection threads is adjusted dynamically, depending
	/// on the number of connections waiting to be served.
	///
	/// It is possible to specify a maximum number of queued connections.
	/// This prevents the connection queue from overflowing in the
	/// case of an extreme server load. In such a case, connections that
	/// cannot be queued are silently and immediately closed.
	///
	/// TCPServer uses a separate thread to accept incoming connections.
	/// Thus, the call to start() returns immediately, and the server
	/// continues to run in the background.
	///
	/// To stop the server from accepting new connections, call stop().
	///
	/// After calling stop(), no new connections will be accepted and
	/// all queued connections will be discarded.
	/// Already served connections, however, will continue being served.
