/* Get the architecture dependend definitions.  The following definitions
   are expected to be done:

   fenv_t	type for object representing an entire floating-point
		environment

   FE_DFL_ENV	macro of type pointer to fenv_t to be used as the argument
		to functions taking an argument of type fenv_t; in this
		case the default environment will be used

   fexcept_t	type for object representing the floating-point exception
		flags including status associated with the flags

   femode_t	type for object representing floating-point control modes

   FE_DFL_MODE	macro of type pointer to const femode_t to be used as the
		argument to fesetmode; in this case the default control
		modes will be used

   The following macros are defined iff the implementation supports this
   kind of exception.
   FE_INEXACT		inexact result
   FE_DIVBYZERO		division by zero
   FE_UNDERFLOW		result not representable due to underflow
   FE_OVERFLOW		result not representable due to overflow
   FE_INVALID		invalid operation

   FE_ALL_EXCEPT	bitwise OR of all supported exceptions

   The next macros are defined iff the appropriate rounding mode is
   supported by the implementation.
   FE_TONEAREST		round to nearest
   FE_UPWARD		round toward +Inf
   FE_DOWNWARD		round toward -Inf
   FE_TOWARDZERO	round toward 0
