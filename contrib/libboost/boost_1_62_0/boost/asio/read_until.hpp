/**
 * This function is used to asynchronously read data into the specified
 * streambuf until the streambuf's get area contains some data that matches a
 * regular expression. The function call always returns immediately. The
 * asynchronous operation will continue until one of the following conditions
 * is true:
 *
 * @li A substring of the streambuf's get area matches the regular expression.
 *
 * @li An error occurred.
 *
 * This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's
 * async_read_some function, and is known as a <em>composed operation</em>. If
 * the streambuf's get area already contains data that matches the regular
 * expression, this asynchronous operation completes immediately. The program
 * must ensure that the stream performs no other read operations (such as
 * async_read, async_read_until, the stream's async_read_some function, or any
 * other composed operations that perform reads) until this operation
 * completes.
 *
 * @param s The stream from which the data is to be read. The type must support
 * the AsyncReadStream concept.
 *
 * @param b A streambuf object into which the data will be read. Ownership of
 * the streambuf is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that it remains
 * valid until the handler is called.
 *
 * @param expr The regular expression.
 *
 * @param handler The handler to be called when the read operation completes.
 * Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the
 * handler must be:
 * @code void handler(
 *   // Result of operation.
 *   const boost::system::error_code& error,
 *
 *   // The number of bytes in the streambuf's get
 *   // area up to and including the substring
 *   // that matches the regular. expression.
 *   // 0 if an error occurred.
 *   std::size_t bytes_transferred
 * ); @endcode
 * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
 * not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of
 * the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using
 * boost::asio::io_service::post().
 *
 * @note After a successful async_read_until operation, the streambuf may
 * contain additional data beyond that which matched the regular expression. An
 * application will typically leave that data in the streambuf for a subsequent
 * async_read_until operation to examine.
 *
 * @par Example
 * To asynchronously read data into a streambuf until a CR-LF sequence is
 * encountered:
 * @code boost::asio::streambuf b;
 * ...
 * void handler(const boost::system::error_code& e, std::size_t size)
 * {
 *   if (!e)
 *   {
 *     std::istream is(&b);
 *     std::string line;
 *     std::getline(is, line);
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 * ...
 * boost::asio::async_read_until(s, b, boost::regex("\r\n"), handler); @endcode
 * After the @c async_read_until operation completes successfully, the buffer
 * @c b contains the data which matched the regular expression:
 * @code { 'a', 'b', ..., 'c', '\r', '\n', 'd', 'e', ... } @endcode
 * The call to @c std::getline then extracts the data up to and including the
 * match, so that the string @c line contains:
 * @code { 'a', 'b', ..., 'c', '\r', '\n' } @endcode
 * The remaining data is left in the buffer @c b as follows:
 * @code { 'd', 'e', ... } @endcode
 * This data may be the start of a new line, to be extracted by a subsequent
 * @c async_read_until operation.

/**
 * This function is used to asynchronously read data into the specified
 * streambuf until a user-defined match condition function object, when applied
 * to the data contained in the streambuf, indicates a successful match. The
 * function call always returns immediately. The asynchronous operation will
 * continue until one of the following conditions is true:
 *
 * @li The match condition function object returns a std::pair where the second
 * element evaluates to true.
 *
 * @li An error occurred.
 *
 * This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's
 * async_read_some function, and is known as a <em>composed operation</em>. If
 * the match condition function object already indicates a match, this
 * asynchronous operation completes immediately. The program must ensure that
 * the stream performs no other read operations (such as async_read,
 * async_read_until, the stream's async_read_some function, or any other
 * composed operations that perform reads) until this operation completes.
 *
 * @param s The stream from which the data is to be read. The type must support
 * the AsyncReadStream concept.
 *
 * @param b A streambuf object into which the data will be read.
 *
 * @param match_condition The function object to be called to determine whether
 * a match exists. The signature of the function object must be:
 * @code pair<iterator, bool> match_condition(iterator begin, iterator end);
 * @endcode
 * where @c iterator represents the type:
 * @code buffers_iterator<basic_streambuf<Allocator>::const_buffers_type>
 * @endcode
 * The iterator parameters @c begin and @c end define the range of bytes to be
 * scanned to determine whether there is a match. The @c first member of the
 * return value is an iterator marking one-past-the-end of the bytes that have
 * been consumed by the match function. This iterator is used to calculate the
 * @c begin parameter for any subsequent invocation of the match condition. The
 * @c second member of the return value is true if a match has been found, false
 * otherwise.
 *
 * @param handler The handler to be called when the read operation completes.
 * Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the
 * handler must be:
 * @code void handler(
 *   // Result of operation.
 *   const boost::system::error_code& error,
 *
 *   // The number of bytes in the streambuf's get
 *   // area that have been fully consumed by the
 *   // match function. O if an error occurred.
 *   std::size_t bytes_transferred
 * ); @endcode
 * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
 * not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of
 * the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using
 * boost::asio::io_service::post().
 *
 * @note After a successful async_read_until operation, the streambuf may
 * contain additional data beyond that which matched the function object. An
 * application will typically leave that data in the streambuf for a subsequent
 * async_read_until operation to examine.
 *
 * @note The default implementation of the @c is_match_condition type trait
 * evaluates to true for function pointers and function objects with a
 * @c result_type typedef. It must be specialised for other user-defined
 * function objects.
 *
 * @par Examples
 * To asynchronously read data into a streambuf until whitespace is encountered:
 * @code typedef boost::asio::buffers_iterator<
 *     boost::asio::streambuf::const_buffers_type> iterator;
 *
 * std::pair<iterator, bool>
 * match_whitespace(iterator begin, iterator end)
 * {
 *   iterator i = begin;
 *   while (i != end)
 *     if (std::isspace(*i++))
 *       return std::make_pair(i, true);
 *   return std::make_pair(i, false);
 * }
 * ...
 * void handler(const boost::system::error_code& e, std::size_t size);
 * ...
 * boost::asio::streambuf b;
 * boost::asio::async_read_until(s, b, match_whitespace, handler);
 * @endcode
 *
 * To asynchronously read data into a streambuf until a matching character is
 * found:
 * @code class match_char
 * {
 * public:
 *   explicit match_char(char c) : c_(c) {}
 *
 *   template <typename Iterator>
 *   std::pair<Iterator, bool> operator()(
