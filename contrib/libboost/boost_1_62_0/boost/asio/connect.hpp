 * be closed.
 *
 * @param begin An iterator pointing to the start of a sequence of endpoints.
 *
 * @param end An iterator pointing to the end of a sequence of endpoints.
 *
 * @param connect_condition A function object that is called prior to each
 * connection attempt. The signature of the function object must be:
 * @code Iterator connect_condition(
 *     const boost::system::error_code& ec,
 *     Iterator next); @endcode
 * The @c ec parameter contains the result from the most recent connect
 * operation. Before the first connection attempt, @c ec is always set to
 * indicate success. The @c next parameter is an iterator pointing to the next
 * endpoint to be tried. The function object should return the next iterator,
 * but is permitted to return a different iterator so that endpoints may be
 * skipped. The implementation guarantees that the function object will never
 * be called with the end iterator.
 *
 * @param handler The handler to be called when the connect operation
 * completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function
 * signature of the handler must be:
 * @code void handler(
 *   // Result of operation. if the sequence is empty, set to
 *   // boost::asio::error::not_found. Otherwise, contains the
 *   // error from the last connection attempt.
 *   const boost::system::error_code& error,
 *
 *   // On success, an iterator denoting the successfully
 *   // connected endpoint. Otherwise, the end iterator.
 *   Iterator iterator
 * ); @endcode
 * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
 * not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation
 * of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using
 * boost::asio::io_service::post().
 *
 * @par Example
 * The following connect condition function object can be used to output
 * information about the individual connection attempts:
 * @code struct my_connect_condition
 * {
 *   template <typename Iterator>
 *   Iterator operator()(
 *       const boost::system::error_code& ec,
 *       Iterator next)
 *   {
 *     if (ec) std::cout << "Error: " << ec.message() << std::endl;
 *     std::cout << "Trying: " << next->endpoint() << std::endl;
 *     return next;
 *   }
 * }; @endcode
 * It would be used with the boost::asio::connect function as follows:
 * @code tcp::resolver r(io_service);
 * tcp::resolver::query q("host", "service");
 * tcp::socket s(io_service);
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * r.async_resolve(q, resolve_handler);
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * void resolve_handler(
 *     const boost::system::error_code& ec,
 *     tcp::resolver::iterator i)
 * {
 *   if (!ec)
 *   {
 *     tcp::resolver::iterator end;
 *     boost::asio::async_connect(s, i, end,
 *         my_connect_condition(),
 *         connect_handler);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * void connect_handler(
 *     const boost::system::error_code& ec,
 *     tcp::resolver::iterator i)
 * {
 *   if (ec)
 *   {
 *     // An error occurred.
 *   }
 *   else
 *   {
 *     std::cout << "Connected to: " << i->endpoint() << std::endl;
 *   }
 * } @endcode
