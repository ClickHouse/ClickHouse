/// Provides core I/O functionality.
/**
 * The io_service class provides the core I/O functionality for users of the
 * asynchronous I/O objects, including:
 *
 * @li boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket
 * @li boost::asio::ip::tcp::acceptor
 * @li boost::asio::ip::udp::socket
 * @li boost::asio::deadline_timer.
 *
 * The io_service class also includes facilities intended for developers of
 * custom asynchronous services.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety
 * @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
 * @e Shared @e objects: Safe, with the specific exceptions of the reset() and
 * notify_fork() functions. Calling reset() while there are unfinished run(),
 * run_one(), poll() or poll_one() calls results in undefined behaviour. The
 * notify_fork() function should not be called while any io_service function,
 * or any function on an I/O object that is associated with the io_service, is
 * being called in another thread.
 *
 * @par Concepts:
 * Dispatcher.
 *
 * @par Synchronous and asynchronous operations
 *
 * Synchronous operations on I/O objects implicitly run the io_service object
 * for an individual operation. The io_service functions run(), run_one(),
 * poll() or poll_one() must be called for the io_service to perform
 * asynchronous operations on behalf of a C++ program. Notification that an
 * asynchronous operation has completed is delivered by invocation of the
 * associated handler. Handlers are invoked only by a thread that is currently
 * calling any overload of run(), run_one(), poll() or poll_one() for the
 * io_service.
 *
 * @par Effect of exceptions thrown from handlers
 *
 * If an exception is thrown from a handler, the exception is allowed to
 * propagate through the throwing thread's invocation of run(), run_one(),
 * poll() or poll_one(). No other threads that are calling any of these
 * functions are affected. It is then the responsibility of the application to
 * catch the exception.
 *
 * After the exception has been caught, the run(), run_one(), poll() or
 * poll_one() call may be restarted @em without the need for an intervening
 * call to reset(). This allows the thread to rejoin the io_service object's
 * thread pool without impacting any other threads in the pool.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * @code
 * boost::asio::io_service io_service;
 * ...
 * for (;;)
 * {
 *   try
 *   {
 *     io_service.run();
 *     break; // run() exited normally
 *   }
 *   catch (my_exception& e)
 *   {
 *     // Deal with exception as appropriate.
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Stopping the io_service from running out of work
 *
 * Some applications may need to prevent an io_service object's run() call from
 * returning when there is no more work to do. For example, the io_service may
 * be being run in a background thread that is launched prior to the
 * application's asynchronous operations. The run() call may be kept running by
 * creating an object of type boost::asio::io_service::work:
 *
 * @code boost::asio::io_service io_service;
 * boost::asio::io_service::work work(io_service);
 * ... @endcode
 *
 * To effect a shutdown, the application will then need to call the io_service
 * object's stop() member function. This will cause the io_service run() call
 * to return as soon as possible, abandoning unfinished operations and without
 * permitting ready handlers to be dispatched.
 *
 * Alternatively, if the application requires that all operations and handlers
 * be allowed to finish normally, the work object may be explicitly destroyed.
 *
 * @code boost::asio::io_service io_service;
 * auto_ptr<boost::asio::io_service::work> work(
 *     new boost::asio::io_service::work(io_service));
 * ...
 * work.reset(); // Allow run() to exit. @endcode
 *
 * @par The io_service class and I/O services
 *
 * Class io_service implements an extensible, type-safe, polymorphic set of I/O
 * services, indexed by service type. An object of class io_service must be
 * initialised before I/O objects such as sockets, resolvers and timers can be
 * used. These I/O objects are distinguished by having constructors that accept
 * an @c io_service& parameter.
 *
 * I/O services exist to manage the logical interface to the operating system on
 * behalf of the I/O objects. In particular, there are resources that are shared
 * across a class of I/O objects. For example, timers may be implemented in
 * terms of a single timer queue. The I/O services manage these shared
 * resources.
 *
 * Access to the services of an io_service is via three function templates,
 * use_service(), add_service() and has_service().
 *
 * In a call to @c use_service<Service>(), the type argument chooses a service,
 * making available all members of the named type. If @c Service is not present
 * in an io_service, an object of type @c Service is created and added to the
 * io_service. A C++ program can check if an io_service implements a
 * particular service with the function template @c has_service<Service>().
 *
 * Service objects may be explicitly added to an io_service using the function
 * template @c add_service<Service>(). If the @c Service is already present, the
 * service_already_exists exception is thrown. If the owner of the service is
 * not the same object as the io_service parameter, the invalid_service_owner
 * exception is thrown.
 *
 * Once a service reference is obtained from an io_service object by calling
 * use_service(), that reference remains usable as long as the owning io_service
 * object exists.
 *
 * All I/O service implementations have io_service::service as a public base
 * class. Custom I/O services may be implemented by deriving from this class and
 * then added to an io_service using the facilities described above.
