/* RDG_genOut
   Generate 'size' bytes of compressible data into stdout.
   Compressibility can be controlled using 'matchProba'.
   'LitProba' is optional, and affect variability of bytes. If litProba==0.0, default value is used.
   Generated data can be selected using 'seed'.
   If (matchProba, litProba and seed) are equal, the function always generate the same content.

   RDG_genBuffer
   Same as RDG_genOut, but generate data into provided buffer
