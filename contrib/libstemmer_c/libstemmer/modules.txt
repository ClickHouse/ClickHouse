# This file contains a list of stemmers to include in the distribution.
# The format is a set of space separated lines - on each line:
#  First item is name of stemmer.
#  Second item is comma separated list of character sets.
#  Third item is comma separated list of names to refer to the stemmer by.
#
# Lines starting with a #, or blank lines, are ignored.

# List all the main algorithms for each language, in UTF-8, and also with
# the most commonly used encoding.

# Some other stemmers in the snowball project are not included in the standard
# distribution. To compile a libstemmer with them in, add them to this list,
# and regenerate the distribution. (You will need a full source checkout for
# this.) They are included in the snowball website as curiosities, but are not
# intended for general use, and use of them is is not fully supported.  These
# algorithms are:
#
# german2          - This is a slight modification of the german stemmer.
#german2          UTF_8,ISO_8859_1        german2		german
#
# kraaij_pohlmann  - This is a different dutch stemmer.
#kraaij_pohlmann  UTF_8,ISO_8859_1        kraaij_pohlmann	dutch
#
# lovins           - This is an english stemmer, but fairly outdated, and
#                    only really applicable to a restricted type of input text
#                    (keywords in academic publications).
