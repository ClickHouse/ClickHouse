/*! \mainpage

This is the API documentation of the
[mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) allocator
(pronounced "me-malloc") -- a
general purpose allocator with excellent [performance](bench.html)
characteristics. Initially
developed by Daan Leijen for the run-time systems of the
[Koka](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka) and [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover/lean) languages.

It is a drop-in replacement for `malloc` and can be used in other programs
without code changes, for example, on Unix you can use it as:
```
> LD_PRELOAD=/usr/bin/libmimalloc.so  myprogram
```

Notable aspects of the design include:

- __small and consistent__: the library is less than 3500 LOC using simple and
  consistent data structures. This makes it very suitable
  to integrate and adapt in other projects. For runtime systems it
  provides hooks for a monotonic _heartbeat_ and deferred freeing (for
  bounded worst-case times with reference counting).
- __free list sharding__: the big idea: instead of one big free list (per size class) we have
  many smaller lists per memory "page" which both reduces fragmentation
  and increases locality --
  things that are allocated close in time get allocated close in memory.
  (A memory "page" in _mimalloc_ contains blocks of one size class and is
  usually 64KiB on a 64-bit system).
- __eager page reset__: when a "page" becomes empty (with increased chance
  due to free list sharding) the memory is marked to the OS as unused ("reset" or "purged")
  reducing (real) memory pressure and fragmentation, especially in long running
  programs.
- __secure__: _mimalloc_ can be build in secure mode, adding guard pages,
  randomized allocation, encrypted free lists, etc. to protect against various
  heap vulnerabilities. The performance penalty is only around 3% on average
  over our benchmarks.
- __first-class heaps__: efficiently create and use multiple heaps to allocate across different regions.
  A heap can be destroyed at once instead of deallocating each object separately.
- __bounded__: it does not suffer from _blowup_ \[1\], has bounded worst-case allocation
  times (_wcat_), bounded space overhead (~0.2% meta-data, with at most 16.7% waste in allocation sizes),
  and has no internal points of contention using only atomic operations.
- __fast__: In our benchmarks (see [below](#performance)),
  _mimalloc_ always outperforms all other leading allocators (_jemalloc_, _tcmalloc_, _Hoard_, etc),
  and usually uses less memory (up to 25% more in the worst case). A nice property
  is that it does consistently well over a wide range of benchmarks.

You can read more on the design of _mimalloc_ in the upcoming technical report
which also has detailed benchmark results.

/*! \page build Building

Checkout the sources from Github:
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc
```

## Windows

Open `ide/vs2017/mimalloc.sln` in Visual Studio 2017 and build.
The `mimalloc` project builds a static library (in `out/msvc-x64`), while the
`mimalloc-override` project builds a DLL for overriding malloc
in the entire program.

## MacOSX, Linux, BSD, etc.

We use [`cmake`](https://cmake.org)<sup>1</sup> as the build system:

```
> mkdir -p out/release
> cd out/release
> cmake ../..
> make
```
This builds the library as a shared (dynamic)
library (`.so` or `.dylib`), a static library (`.a`), and
as a single object file (`.o`).

`> sudo make install` (install the library and header files in `/usr/local/lib`  and `/usr/local/include`)

You can build the debug version which does many internal checks and
maintains detailed statistics as:

```
> mkdir -p out/debug
> cd out/debug
> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
> make
```
This will name the shared library as `libmimalloc-debug.so`.

Finally, you can build a _secure_ version that uses guard pages, encrypted
free lists, etc, as:
```
> mkdir -p out/secure
> cd out/secure
> cmake -DSECURE=ON ../..
> make
```
This will name the shared library as `libmimalloc-secure.so`.
Use `ccmake`<sup>2</sup> instead of `cmake`
to see and customize all the available build options.

Notes:
1. Install CMake: `sudo apt-get install cmake`
2. Install CCMake: `sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui`

*/

/*! \page using Using the library


The preferred usage is including `<mimalloc.h>`, linking with
the shared- or static library, and using the `mi_malloc` API exclusively for allocation. For example,
```
gcc -o myprogram -lmimalloc myfile.c
```

mimalloc uses only safe OS calls (`mmap` and `VirtualAlloc`) and can co-exist
with other allocators linked to the same program.
If you use `cmake`, you can simply use:
```
find_package(mimalloc 1.0 REQUIRED)
```
in your `CMakeLists.txt` to find a locally installed mimalloc. Then use either:
```
target_link_libraries(myapp PUBLIC mimalloc)
```
to link with the shared (dynamic) library, or:
```
target_link_libraries(myapp PUBLIC mimalloc-static)
```
to link with the static library. See `test\CMakeLists.txt` for an example.


You can pass environment variables to print verbose messages (`MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1`)
and statistics (`MIMALLOC_STATS=1`) (in the debug version):
```
> env MIMALLOC_STATS=1 ./cfrac 175451865205073170563711388363

The above model of using the `mi_` prefixed API is not always possible
though in existing programs that already use the standard malloc interface,
and another option is to override the standard malloc interface
completely and redirect all calls to the _mimalloc_ library instead.

See \ref overrides for more info.

*/

/*! \page overrides Overriding Malloc

Overriding the standard `malloc` can be done either _dynamically_ or _statically_.

## Dynamic override

This is the recommended way to override the standard malloc interface.

### Unix, BSD, MacOSX

On these systems we preload the mimalloc shared
library so all calls to the standard `malloc` interface are
resolved to the _mimalloc_ library.

- `env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so myprogram` (on Linux, BSD, etc.)
- `env DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=usr/lib/libmimalloc.dylib myprogram` (On MacOSX)

  Note certain security restrictions may apply when doing this from
  the [shell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43941322/dyld-insert-libraries-ignored-when-calling-application-through-bash).

You can set extra environment variables to check that mimalloc is running,
like:
```
env MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so myprogram
```
or run with the debug version to get detailed statistics:
```
env MIMALLOC_STATS=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc-debug.so myprogram
```

### Windows

On Windows you need to link your program explicitly with the mimalloc
DLL, and use the C-runtime library as a DLL (the `/MD` or `/MDd` switch).
To ensure the mimalloc DLL gets loaded it is easiest to insert some
call to the mimalloc API in the `main` function, like `mi_version()`.

Due to the way mimalloc intercepts the standard malloc at runtime, it is best
to link to the mimalloc import library first on the command line so it gets
loaded right after the universal C runtime DLL (`ucrtbase`). See
the `mimalloc-override-test` project for an example.


## Static override

On Unix systems, you can also statically link with _mimalloc_ to override the standard
malloc interface. The recommended way is to link the final program with the
_mimalloc_ single object file (`mimalloc-override.o`). We use
an object file instead of a library file as linkers give preference to
that over archives to resolve symbols. To ensure that the standard
malloc interface resolves to the _mimalloc_ library, link it as the first
object file. For example:

```
gcc -o myprogram mimalloc-override.o  myfile1.c ...
```



## List of Overrides:

The specific functions that get redirected to the _mimalloc_ library are:

```
// C
void*  malloc(size_t size);
void*  calloc(size_t size, size_t n);
void*  realloc(void* p, size_t newsize);
void   free(void* p);

// C++
void   operator delete(void* p);
void   operator delete[](void* p);

void*  operator new(std::size_t n) noexcept(false);
void*  operator new[](std::size_t n) noexcept(false);
void*  operator new( std::size_t n, std::align_val_t align) noexcept(false);
void*  operator new[]( std::size_t n, std::align_val_t align) noexcept(false);

void*  operator new  ( std::size_t count, const std::nothrow_t& tag);
void*  operator new[]( std::size_t count, const std::nothrow_t& tag);
void*  operator new  ( std::size_t count, std::align_val_t al, const std::nothrow_t&);
void*  operator new[]( std::size_t count, std::align_val_t al, const std::nothrow_t&);

// Posix
int    posix_memalign(void** p, size_t alignment, size_t size);

// Linux
void*  memalign(size_t alignment, size_t size);
void*  aligned_alloc(size_t alignment, size_t size);
void*  valloc(size_t size);
void*  pvalloc(size_t size);
size_t malloc_usable_size(void *p);

// BSD
void*  reallocarray( void* p, size_t count, size_t size );
void*  reallocf(void* p, size_t newsize);
void   cfree(void* p);

// Windows
void*  _expand(void* p, size_t newsize);
size_t _msize(void* p);

void*  _malloc_dbg(size_t size, int block_type, const char* fname, int line);
void*  _realloc_dbg(void* p, size_t newsize, int block_type, const char* fname, int line);
void*  _calloc_dbg(size_t count, size_t size, int block_type, const char* fname, int line);
void*  _expand_dbg(void* p, size_t size, int block_type, const char* fname, int line);
size_t _msize_dbg(void* p, int block_type);
void   _free_dbg(void* p, int block_type);
```

/*! \page bench Performance

We tested _mimalloc_ against many other top allocators over a wide
range of benchmarks, ranging from various real world programs to
synthetic benchmarks that see how the allocator behaves under more
extreme circumstances.

In our benchmarks, _mimalloc_ always outperforms all other leading
allocators (_jemalloc_, _tcmalloc_, _Hoard_, etc) (Apr 2019),
and usually uses less memory (up to 25% more in the worst case).
A nice property is that it does *consistently* well over the wide
range of benchmarks.

See the [Performance](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc#Performance)
section in the _mimalloc_ repository for benchmark results,
or the the technical report for detailed benchmark results.
