# basic_json::meta

```cpp
static basic_json meta();
```

This function returns a JSON object with information about the library,
including the version number and information on the platform and compiler.
    
## Return value

JSON object holding version information

key         | description
----------- | ---------------
`compiler`  | Information on the used compiler. It is an object with the following keys: `c++` (the used C++ standard), `family` (the compiler family; possible values are `clang`, `icc`, `gcc`, `ilecpp`, `msvc`, `pgcpp`, `sunpro`, and `unknown`), and `version` (the compiler version).

## Exception safety

Strong guarantee: if an exception is thrown, there are no
changes to any JSON value.

## Complexity

Constant.
