.SH NAME
rblckeck \- DNSBL lookup utility

.SH SYNOPSYS
.B rblcheck
.RB [\| \-s
.IR zone \|]
.RB [\| \-S
.IR zone\-file \|]
.RB [\| \-c \|]
.RB [\| \-tmvq \|]
.RB [\| \-n
.IR nsaddr \|]
.IR address \|.\|.\|.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rblcheck
is a simple command-line to perform DNSBL (DNS-based blocklists) lookups.
For every IP address (or a name, in which case it will be resolved to an
address first), the utility verifies whenever it is listed in a (list of)
DNS blocklists specified with
.B \-s
or
.B \-S
options, optionally obtains text assotiated with the listing (usually it
is either some description about the reason of the listing or an URL
referring to such a description), and displays results on standard output.
.PP
The program is implemented on top of
.BR udns (3)
library.

.SH OPTIONS

The following options are recognized by
.BR rblcheck :

.TP
.B \-s \fIzone\fR
add the given \fIzone\fR DNSBL name to the list of active zones.
.TP
.B \-S \fIzone-file\fR
add list of zones from the named \fIzone-file\fR to the list of
active zones (the file specifies one zone as the first word on a
line, empty lines and lines starting with `#' character are ignored).
.TP
.B \-c
reset active zone list.
.TP
.B \-v
be more verbose, produce more detailed output.
.TP
.B \-q
the opposite for \fB\-v\fR -- produce less detailed output.
.TP
.B \-t
obtain text for listed addresses.
.TP
.B \-n \fInsaddr\fR
Use the given nameserver (given as IPv4 or IPv6 address) instead of the
default.  The same effect may be achieved by setting $NSCACHEIP environment
variable.
.TP
.B \-m
stop after first hit, ie after the first address which is found to be
listed.

.TP
.B \-h
print short help and exit.

.PP
If no
.BR \-s ,
.BR \-S
and
.B \-c
options are given,
.B rblcheck
will try to obtain list of zones using $RBLCHECK_ZONES environment variable,
or ~/.rblcheckrc, or /etc/rblckechrc files, in that order.  If no zones are
found, it will exit unsuccessefully.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
When no addresses given are listed and no errors occured,
.B rblcheck
exits with code 0.  If at least one address is listed,
.B rblcheck
returns 100.  In case of DNS errors,
.B rblcheck
returns 2.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP
.B $RBLCHECK_ZONES
if no
.BR \-s ,
.B \-S
or
.B \-c
option is given,
.B rblcheck
tries this variable to obtain list of DNSBL zones to check against.

.SH FILES

.TP
$HOME/.rblcheckrc and /etc/rblcheckrc
if no
.BR \-s ,
.B \-S
or
.B \-c
option is given, and no $RBLCHECK_ZONES environment variable is set,
.B rblcheck
will try the two files (the first one that exists) to obtain list of
DNSBL zones to check against.
Each line specifies one zone (only first word in each line is used).
Empty lines and lines starting with `#' character are ignored.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR dnsget (1)
.BR resolv.conf (5)
.BR udns (3).
