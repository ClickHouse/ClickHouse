	 * This might appear controversial, but the fact is that generic
	 * prime method was observed to deliver better performance even
	 * for NIST primes on a range of platforms, e.g.: 60%-15%
	 * improvement on IA-64, ~25% on ARM, 30%-90% on P4, 20%-25%
	 * in 32-bit build and 35%--12% in 64-bit build on Core2...
	 * Coefficients are relative to optimized bn_nist.c for most
	 * intensive ECDSA verify and ECDH operations for 192- and 521-
	 * bit keys respectively. Choice of these boundary values is
	 * arguable, because the dependency of improvement coefficient
	 * from key length is not a "monotone" curve. For example while
	 * 571-bit result is 23% on ARM, 384-bit one is -1%. But it's
	 * generally faster, sometimes "respectfully" faster, sometimes
	 * "tolerably" slower... What effectively happens is that loop
	 * with bn_mul_add_words is put against bn_mul_mont, and the
	 * latter "wins" on short vectors. Correct solution should be
	 * implementing dedicated NxN multiplication subroutines for
	 * small N. But till it materializes, let's stick to generic
	 * prime method...
