	/*
	 * The original reason for implementing this(*) was the fact that
	 * pre-21164a Alpha CPUs don't have byte load/store instructions
	 * and e.g. a byte store has to be done with 64-bit load, shift,
	 * and, or and finally 64-bit store. Peaking data and operating
	 * at natural word size made it possible to reduce amount of
	 * instructions as well as to perform early read-ahead without
	 * suffering from RAW (read-after-write) hazard. This resulted
	 * in ~40%(**) performance improvement on 21064 box with gcc.
	 * But it's not only Alpha users who win here:-) Thanks to the
	 * early-n-wide read-ahead this implementation also exhibits
	 * >40% speed-up on SPARC and 20-30% on 64-bit MIPS (depending
	 * on sizeof(RC4_INT)).
	 *
	 * (*)	"this" means code which recognizes the case when input
	 *	and output pointers appear to be aligned at natural CPU
	 *	word boundary
	 * (**)	i.e. according to 'apps/openssl speed rc4' benchmark,
	 *	crypto/rc4/rc4speed.c exhibits almost 70% speed-up...
	 *
	 * Caveats.
	 *
	 * - RC4_CHUNK="unsigned long long" should be a #1 choice for
	 *   UltraSPARC. Unfortunately gcc generates very slow code
	 *   (2.5-3 times slower than one generated by Sun's WorkShop
	 *   C) and therefore gcc (at least 2.95 and earlier) should
	 *   always be told that RC4_CHUNK="unsigned long".
