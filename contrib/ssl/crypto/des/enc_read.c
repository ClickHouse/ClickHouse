 * WARNINGS:
 *
 *  -  The data format used by DES_enc_write() and DES_enc_read()
 *     has a cryptographic weakness: When asked to write more
 *     than MAXWRITE bytes, DES_enc_write will split the data
 *     into several chunks that are all encrypted
 *     using the same IV.  So don't use these functions unless you
 *     are sure you know what you do (in which case you might
 *     not want to use them anyway).
 *
 *  -  This code cannot handle non-blocking sockets.
 *
 *  -  This function uses an internal state and thus cannot be
 *     used on multiple files.
