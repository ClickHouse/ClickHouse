                If a test takes too long by mistake, the entire test task can
                time out and the author won't get a proper message. Put some cap
                on query execution time to prevent this. Test query run time is
                limited to about 2 seconds, but this limit applies to all queries,
                including fill/create and maintenance such as downloading trace
                logs, so it must be generous enough. As a second line of defense,
                we might also add time check to perf.py script.
